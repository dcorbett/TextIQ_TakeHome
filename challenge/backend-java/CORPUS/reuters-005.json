        "body": "CitiCorp <CCI> appears to be digging\nin its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of\ndollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall\nStreet analysts said.\n    \"I view it as pre-negotiation posturing,\" said analyst\nCarole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both\nBrazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on\nits commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first\nquarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it\nlists the loans as non-performing status.\n    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, indicating a material change in its financial\nsituation. \"Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats,\nwe'll make your loans non-performing right now,\" Berger said.\n    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90\ndays without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation\nwill be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.\n    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by\ntalking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between\nU.S. and European banks.\n    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is\nunlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half\nof this year.\n    \"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on\nall the interest they owe,\" Cohn said. \"The real issue is the\nrescheduling of debt terms.\n    Another question is whether or not the International\nMonetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.\n    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in\nlate dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off\ntheir lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.\n    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on\nnon-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said\ninvestors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at\npresent levels for the \"tremendous fundamental values\" in the\ngroup.\n    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said\nManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure to\nBrazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of\nearnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among\nNew York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers Trust\nCo <BT> which happen to have the least exposure.\n    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers\nTrust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have\nlower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. \n    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more\ninvolved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up\na brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed\ncountries.\n    \"I don't see any reason to change full year earnings\nestimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He\nthinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a\nsituation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.\n    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became\nnon-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks\ncame to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was\npaid. \"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,\"\nhe said.\n    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a\nworst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that\nBrazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through\nsome economic upheaval after the transition from a military to\na civilian government.\n    \"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative\nto their ability to service it,\" said John Mason of\nInterstate Securities. \"We've been fiddling around with these\nproblems for five years and the hour is growing late.\"\n    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut\ninterest rates internally and extended maturities and none of\nthese measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of\nas much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees\npartial write downs of some loans.\n    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks \ncould be poised for a short term rally.\n    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it is\npremature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. \"It is our\nexpectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet\nits debt,\" a spokesman said.\n    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to\nmake a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said\nmuch the same thing.\n    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3\nbillion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is\nsubject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of\ninterest.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

The eight\ndomestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.\n    GM said its sales of domestic-built cars in the March 1-10\nperiod declined to 97,487 from 104,952 a year ago while truck\nsales rose 14.4 pct to 40,131 from 35,081. There were eight\nselling days in each period.\n    Despite the lower car sales, the giant automaker had a\nbright spot as its Chevrolet division, which is launching a\nnational sales campaign this month for its new Corsica and\nBeretta compact cars, was up almost 21 pct when only\ndomestic-built cars were counted. GM's Buick division was also\nup, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac was\noff 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.\n    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6\npct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said was\npartly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.\n    Meanwhile, Ford said its car sales rose 5.9 pct to 50,407\ncompared with 47,592 a year ago while truck sales gained by\n12.6 pct to 35,814 from 31,811.\n    Number three Chrysler's car sales gained to 0.4 pct to\n25,286 from 25,191 while its truck sales gained 15 pct to\n15,565 from 13,585. The truck sales were a record for the\nperiod, the company said.\n    Among the smaller makers, Honda <HMC> said domestic car\nsales rose 16 pct to 4,394 from 3,786 and Volkswagen of America\nrose 4.9 pct to 849 from 809.\n    American Motors Corp <AMO> fell 57 pct to 760 from 1,780\nfor cars but rose 18 pct in jeep sales to 4,500 from 3,800.\n    Nissan <NSANY> car sales rose 19.1 pct to 2,137 from 1,794\nand gained 3.6 pct on trucks to 1,686 from 1,628.

It would seek fair trade in agriculture,\nseek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and\nexport practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and\nnon-tariff barriers.\n     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT\nagreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority\nto negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended\nthrough January 3, 1991.\n    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an\ninternational coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.\n    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar\nimported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production\nof sugar or products containing sugar and destined for\nre-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur\nbefore Octoer 1, 1991.\n    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be\nprocessed within three years after import and exported within\nfive years.\n    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in\ncomplaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from\nimports.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Central banks have easily beaten back\nthe foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized\nnations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.\n    In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,\nsterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But\noperators got their fingers burned as one by one the central\nbanks signalled their displeasure.\n    \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O'Neill,\nfinancial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.\n    \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they\nwon't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind\ncurrencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.\n    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank\ngovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.\n-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under\nwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of\nexchange rates around prevailing levels.\n    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an\nattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable\ntwo-year decline against major world currencies.\n    And initially, traders indicated their respect for the\naccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.\n    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87\nmarks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before\nthe G-6 accord.\n    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy\npicked up steam in February at the same time as the West German\neconomy was regressing.\n    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave\ntraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the\nidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.\n    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank\nactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply\ntelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading\nconditions.\n    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around\n1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its\nface so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.\n    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England\nintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.\ncurrency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the\nG-6 pact.\n    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like\nthe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after\ntraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant\nto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays\non dollar/mark and dollar/yen.\n    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving\nU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March\n17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the\nincumbent Conservative party in any general election.\n    \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\n    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870\ndlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday\nand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There's been some\nheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's\nU.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.\n    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and\nBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift into\nCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were\nstymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.\n    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar\ntoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.\n    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,\nsold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.\n    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents\ntoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday.\n    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden\nupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next\nstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a\nvery tight range against the dollar for several months.\n    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.\nAnalysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long\nsterling/short mark positions established lately.\n    \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of\nthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations\nare ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said.\n    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,\nlower industrial output and slowing employment gains.\n    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who\nhave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian\nfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the\nend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.\n    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most\ncontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with\nJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of\nthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.\n    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through\nthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it\nintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.\nOn that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.\n    \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in\nJanuary. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches\non and the situation changes,\" said McGroarty of Discount.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

We told them we wish to pay but\nthat first we must make sure that the country grows,\" Gros said.\n    \"We pointed out to them that in the last two years Brazil\npaid 24 billion dlrs just in interest rates, while only\nreceiving two billion dlrs in new loans over a similar period.\"\nGros reiterated that Brazil will not accept interference from\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), as creditors suggested.\n    \"The performance of the IMF over the years has not been\nconvenient to our needs. It is an important institution, but we\ndo not accept it to monitor our economy,\" he said.\n    \"The banks would welcome us going to the IMF. We would\nwelcome if they pardoned half our debt,\" Gros said.\n    Brazil announced suspension of interest payment of 68\nbillion dlrs owed to commercial foreign banks on February 20.\nNo deadline was established for the renewal of the payment.\n    \"Our major commitment is with the country's growth.\nTherefore, we need more money to invest on new projects,\" Gros\nsaid.  He said that before the announcement of the suspension\nof interest payment, Brazil was paying about 500 mln dlrs a\nmonth to its commercial foreign creditors.\n    \"We can say that at least we are saving some money,\" he said.\n    Gros said Brazil has not submitted specific proposals to\ncreditors, and instead hopes that proposals would come through\nbilateral negotiations.\n    The Central Bank president said he will be going next week\nto Washington to take part in a meeting of the Inter American\nDevelopment Bank .\n    In Brasilia, sources linked to the Presidency said Brazil\nwas preparing a new program of economic readjustment to\nstrengthen its negotiations on its 109 billion dlr foreign\ndebt.

Unless we get\ngovernment relief, the company will be bankrupt in three\nyears,\" he told reuters.\n    La electricidad's problems stem from the government's\ndecember decision to set private debt payments at 7.50 bolivars\nper dollar instead of 4.3.\n    Company officials estimate that the currency change raised\nthe debt to 4.67 billion bolivars from 2.67 billion. additional\npreferential dollar premiums put the total cost at 7.47\nbillion, not including interest payments.\n    Under the government plan for repaying the 7.8 billion dlr\nprivate debt, the central bank will guarantee debtors their\ndollars at 7.5 with a premium of 4.50 per dollar.\n    La electricidad president francisco aguerrevere will meet\nhis bank advisory committee, led by morgan guaranty, to explain\nthat unless government assistance is forthcoming the company\ncannot meet its obligations.\n    La electricidad ceased principal payments under a five-year\nrefinancing plan last year, althouigh interest has been paid,\nthe officials said. They said exchange contracts, which the\ngovernment no longer recognizes, were signed with the central\nbank for this refinancing at 4.3 per dollar.\n    The company spokesman said the new york meeting will be\nheld to inform the committee, representing 72 banks, of the\nlatest developments on efforts to lobby the government.\n    \"the banks are anxious to know the situation on debt\npayments, but we can only tell them we are waiting for a\ngovernment response to our proposals,\" he said.\n    La electricidad is seeking permission for a 50 pct rate\nincrease, which officials say would bring in an extra 1.3\nbillion bolivars this year.\n    The 30 pct tariff increase introduced in january will only\nbring in an extra 600 mln bolivars per year against additional\ndebt costs of 900 mln.\n    Without relief, the company will incur losses of 287 mln\nbolivars this year, 556 mln in 1988, 733 mln in 1989 and 1.47\nbillion in 1990. In 1990 the company would be decapitalized 874\nmln bolivars.\n    As alternatives to the rate increase, the company has also\nproposed allowing la electricidad a grace period on payment of\nthe exchange risk premium to the central bank, a longer period\nto pay it, or a soft loan from the government.\n    The company spokesman said the government has not responded\nto the proposals and there have been no formal meetings since\njanuary.\n    \"if these solutions are not agreed to, we face the final\nresort of either the government buying the debt or the company\nbeing nationalised,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)\nfigures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation\nReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral\nto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown\nwould be needed to assess the full price impact.\n    \"Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in\ncorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the\ntrade was looking for,\" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham\nLambert said.\n    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into\nthe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837\nacres.\n    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of\nplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but\nsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimates\nslightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions\nfigures March 31.\n    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program\nrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage\nto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.\n    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,\nsaid there was not enough information to completely assess the\nconservation figures. \"The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly\ndisappointing,\" he added.\n    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the\nenrollment figures.\n    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for\nboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an\nupward adjustment in planting intention figures.\n    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates\nonto the market this spring, he said: \"The trade was definitely\nlooking higher, so certificates are going to be less than\nexpected.\"\n    The USDA offered a special corn \"bonus\" rental payment to\nthe farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus\namounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program\npayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the\nreserve.\n    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said\nthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had\nexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations were\nconsiderably higher than the actual figures.\n    \"I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the\nlong run,\" she said.\n    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some\nconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure\nbetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or\nthe latest addition.\n    \"It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid\ninto the program,\" she said.\n    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas\nabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservation\nsign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as\n61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the\nhigh 60's.\n    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight\nreduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to\naround 64 mln acres.\n    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed\nearlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,\ndespite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor\nyielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to\nfinal production figures.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Mexico has temporarily suspended its\ndebt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as an\nattempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks to\nparticipate in a new 7.7 billion dlr loan for the country.\n    The scheme, which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesos\nto finance investment in Mexico, is likely to resume soon after\nthe loan package is signed on March 20.\n    But the move is a further indication of the strains that\nhave developed between Mexico and the banks because of the\ndifficulty of syndicating the huge loan, bankers said.\n    Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program on\nFebruary 25.\n    Adolfo Hegewisch, Mexico's Undersecretary for Commerce,\nconfirmed that the swap program had been halted, but he told a\nEuromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had been\nforced to act because it had been inundated with applications.\n    Between January 1 and February 15, 132 firms had applied to\ndo a debt-equity conversion, compared with 100 between May and\nDecember 1986. \"We were not accustomed to receive so much\nwork,\" said Hegewisch, who is responsible for foreign\ninvestment in Mexico.\n    Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs had\npiled up at the finance ministry, which has said it wants to\nlimit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month.\n    But some bankers, who declined to be identified, said the\nhalt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on the\nbanks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditors\nworldwide to participate in the loan.\n    Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed, but dozens of\nsmaller banks are still baulking. Assistant U.S. Treasury\nSecretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance of\nthese banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage.\n    \"The Mexicans basically said, We're not going to subsidize\nforeigners until we have a deal,\" one banker said.\n    Other bankers, however, said Mexico's motives were not so\nsinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absence\nof top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks.\n    \"They want to focus on the deal, and they wanted the banks\nto focus on the deal,\" one source said.\n    Apart from the present disruption, bankers and company\nofficials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a huge\nsuccess.    \n    Frank Fountain, Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp, said\na 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothly\nthat Chrysler has plans for more.\n    Chrysler, working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co,\nbought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mln\ndlrs, mainly from European banks. The cost was about 65 mln\ndlrs in cash and paper.\n    It then presented the paper to Mexico's central bank and\nreceived the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which it\ninvested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export to\nNorth America.\n    Susan Segal, senior vice president of Manufacturers\nHanover, said the swaps not only reduce Mexico's debt burden\nbut help to recapitalize local industries that may have been\nsqueezed out of the local capital markets.\n    Fountain said that even a large well-established firm such\nas Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term peso\nfinancing on reasonable terms in Mexico.\n    Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date,\nand Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pending\nare for investments in the electronic and chemical industries,\nwith Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest.\n    But the interest is spreading. Segal said Manufacturers\nHanover has been authorized to convert part of its own\nportfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels.\n    She said the sums involved are considerable, but gave no\ndetails. The bank is also looking into joint ventures with\nmanufacturing and trading companies, Segal added.\n    And, as part of the agreement with the banks that will be\nsigned next week, Mexican residents will be allowed to\nparticipate in the scheme, hitherto reserved for foreign firms,\nin the hope that some of the 30 billion dlrs estimated to be\nheld abroad will be repatriated.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Even today it pressured the market. But it will\nquickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go\nover the top,\" Arango said in an interview.\n    \"Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but\nconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react\nto market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give\nits coffee away,\" he added.\n    Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including\na lower export registration price, as a major change in\nColombia's coffee marketing policy.\n    The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to\n1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70\nkilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs).\n    The government announced a more flexible policy of\nreintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which\narango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will\nundoubtedly be more actively present in the market.\n    A frequent gap between international market prices and the\nreintegro was unlikely to recur, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Negotiators at a United Nations\nconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement\n(INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference\nchairman Manaspas Xuto said.\n    \"We have resolved major differences of opinion,\" he told\nReuters.\n    Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,\nto replace the current one which expires in October.\n    Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperative\natmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since the\ntalks began last Monday.\n    \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to\nratify the new agreement,\" he added.\n    The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the\nU.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the\nfourth such meeting in two years.\n    Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four\npoints:\n    1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.\n    Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals\nbetween price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.\n    2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over\nsix months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower\nintervention price (or the upper intervention price), the\nreference price will be automatically revised downwards (or\nupwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber\nOrganisation council decides on a higher percentage.\n    If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,\nthe reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct\nunless the council decides on a higher percentage.\n    3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at\nwhich the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is\nbrought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents\nabove the floor price -- or 152 cents.\n    4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the\ntalks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to\nlower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last\nnight, setting the stage for compromise.\n    Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and\nformal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking\npart in the conference is expected to take place on March 20.\n    The current conference was widely seen as the last chance\nto clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new\nfive- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in\nOctober over consumer demands for tighter controls of the\nbuffer stock.\n    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and\nBritain are the major consumers.\n    UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in\nrubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It had increased its involvement in development projects\nby 60 pct in the last two years, he said.\n    Knox said banks would grant Argentina loans of up to two\nbillion dlrs over the next two years to help the country meet\ngrowth targets.

The\nYugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.\n    Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs.\n    Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG\n<HFAG.F> two years ago.\n    Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects,\ninvolving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi\nSad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring\nfor and exploiting oil and natural gas.\n    An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained\nfrom fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said.\n    Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil\nproduction, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year.\n    Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and\nservices to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's\nleading export enterprises.\n    In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it\nhas successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over\n3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly\nprospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there.\n    Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start\nsoon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest\nabout 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area.\n    Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the\nTunisian government, has transferred one third of its option\nrights in the region to Ina, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The government has also\nsent marines into the main ports.\n    A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de\nJaneiro said unions were studying an offer by private\nshipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.\n    Seamen employed by two small companies have already\naccepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about\n5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.\n    Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of\nthousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high\ninterest rates charged by banks.\n    According to official estimates, prices rose by more than\n33 pct in the first two months of this year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Since then, it has been beset by inner wrangling\nand its popularity among Britain's voters has tumbled.\n    Morale among Labour politicians slumped further last month\nwhen the party lost a key by-election in Greenwich, south\nLondon -- a seat which Labour had held for 50 years.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold of\ncrates of newly printed currency.\"\n    Diaz did not give figures, but said: \"We believe they still\nhave a lot of funds. These are the funds that they will use in\nthe coming elections. These are the funds that they used to\nstage those coups.\"\n    He was referring to congressional elections scheduled for\nMay 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by President\nCorazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.\n    Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and property\nvalued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered shares\nof stock of at least 286 firms. \"We have achieved more than what\nwe thought we could achieve in one year,\" he added.\n    The PCGG, set up by Aquino in February 1986, has sweeping\npowers of sequestration, seizure and inspection of bank\naccounts. Diaz said the panel's main task is to gather evidence\nfor legal prosecution. \"But we have to sequester before we file\na case and that is the legal objection because they say that we\nshoot first before we ask questions,\" he said.\n    He said dividends from seized shares were held in trust\nfunds pending court verdicts, adding several Marcos associates\nhad made confessions about their wealth. He did not name them.\n    \"They are very concerned and afraid that if their names\nappear something may happen to them,\" he said.\n    The government last week announced that businessman Antonio\nFloirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the \"banana king,\" had\nturned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised to\nsurrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worth\nanother 180 mln pesos. In return, the PCGG said it had lifted\nfreeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.\n    Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreements\nwith another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. He said\nBenedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers and\nradio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of the\nboards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.\n    Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth on\nincome-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.\n\"Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we have\nto recover,\" he said.\n    He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe street\ncertificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchanges\nwas prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were in\ncirculation.\n    Street certificates describe securities held in the name of\na broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as to\npermit easy trading or transfer.\n    Share prices at the two exchanges reacted nervously last\nTuesday when news of the probe leaked. The composite index at\nthe Manila Stock Exchange fell 18.61 points to 451.51, while\nthat at the Makati Stock Exchange slipped 1.7326 points to\nclose at 63.0618. There was a slight recovery the following\nday.\n    The presidents of the two exchanges appealed to Diaz to\ncarry out the probe discreetly so investors were not scared\naway, saying street certificates did not necessarily indicate\n\"anomalous transactions.\"\n    \"It's unfortunate that (news of the probe) leaked out to the\npapers,\" Diaz said.\n    Diaz said PCGG suspicions were aroused by the stock market\nboom over the past year. The Manila Stock Exchange composite\nindex jumped 224 pct from 131.32 to 424.81 in 1986.\n    \"One of our functions is to see to it that these assets that\nwe have sequestered do not go right back into the hands of the\n(Marcos) cronies,\" he said.\n    \"We want to make sure that these stock exchanges are not\nbeing manipulated by the cronies because maybe they want to\nlaunder their pesos and that is why the prices are just\nskyrocketing.\"\n    Diaz said the PCGG would limit its probe to sequestered\nstock in brewery giant San Miguel Corp, the Philippine Long\nDistance Telephone Co, mining conglomerate Benguet Corp, and\nOriental Petroleum and Minerals Corp.\n    Shares of the four companies are among the most frequently\ntraded on the two stock exchanges.\n    Diaz said at a meeting with the heads of the two exchanges\nlast Thursday that the PCGG would act prudently in its\ninvestigation of street certificates, adding the panel\nsupported government efforts to create a favourable investment\nclimate.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer\nsaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18\ndlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there\nwas no immediate need to change it.\n    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news\nagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three\nmln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC\nquota.\n    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will\ncontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members\nadhere to the pact, Nazer said.\n    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production\nceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices\naveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.\n    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki\nYamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new\nmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting\nwill take place as scheduled.\"\n    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all\nmembers were abiding by its agreements.\n    \"We've heard news every now and then of violations but they\nwere not at all verified,\" he said.\n    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a\n13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near\n18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.\n    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but\nhave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as\ntraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.\n    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its\n4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.\n    \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as\ndevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to\nthe agreement,\" he said.\n    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the\nNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating\nstorage, Nazer said.\n    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and\nVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price\nstability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful\ncompetition with OPEC.\n    \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly\ndesires price stability,\" he said.\n    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had\nreturned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC.\n    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln\nbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and\nover-production by some OPEC states.\n    \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played\nby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8\nmln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other\nmembers of OPEC,\" Nazer said.\n    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third\nquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.\n    But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the\nOPEC members will consult with each other and take the\nnecessary measures.\"\n    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when\ndemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern\nhemisphere spring and summer.\n    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation\nfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union\nagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after\nhe visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.\n    \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were\nprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise market\nconditions and to help themselves attain better pricing\nconditions,\" Nazer said.\n    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate\n-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if\nthey saw fit.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Saudi Arabian business\nleaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out\nproblems facing the private sector of the kingdom's\noil-dependent economy.\n    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi\nArabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and\ncommerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.\n    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the\nmountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,\nhas been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.\n    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce\nMinister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.\n    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air\nproblems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide\nin oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in\na private sector sorely short of finance.\n    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,\nthe world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private\nenterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.\n    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle\nEast recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing\nand trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.\n    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord\nreached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost\nprices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.\n    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the\nturn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a\n52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down\nforeign reserves.\n    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of\nconfidence to the business community.\n    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last\nNovember, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the\nnumber of new non-performing loans.\n    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate\nfinance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to\nlend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am\nnot sure if it is firmly based.\"\n    Some businessmen and bankers point out that government\nspending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy\nmay still be contracting.\n    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.\nA U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the\nbudget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of\nthe government's highest priorities, the recession, the\npayments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi\nand foreign investor interest in industry.\"\n    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a\nmajor issue among the businessmen gathered here.\n    Official figures show the number of new licences for\nindustrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March\n1986, compared with the same period in 1985.\n    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major\nsource of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.\n    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge\ninventories of construction equipment as recession bit.\n    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.\nOthers have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached\nagreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.\n    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels\nconglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a\ndraft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of\nbank debt.\n    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely\nto discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to\nstep up investment in the kingdom.\n    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after\nholding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi\noutlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft\nworth five billion stg.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Automobiles Citroen expects rising\nsales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits\nsignificantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after\nsix straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.\n    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX\nsports model, he said: \"All the budgetary forecasts that we have\nbeen able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement\nin 1987, compared with 1986,\" he added.\n    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,\nincreased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in\nfirst two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is\naiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after\n11.7 pct in 1986.\n    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the\nEuropean market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from\n2.9 pct in 1986.\n    \"Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the\ndemand,\" Calvet said. \"This is a relatively new problem for us.\"\n    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut\nthe deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise\nits range and improve productivity.\n    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986\nprofit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.\n    This weekend he said that those profit estimates \"remain\nabout the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.\"\n    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the\nAX, launched on the French market last October. It will be\navailable throughout most of western Europe within four months.\n    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.\n    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-\nBois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and\nVigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of\n1,000 cars a day.\n    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model\nbetween its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to\ncompete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.\n    The AX had built up its market share in France to around\nfour pct last month. Calvet said: \"Our hope is that once the AX\nis fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent\nof the national market.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leading industrial nations will meet\nagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,\nbut U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now\nthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic\ngrowth.\n    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly\nsuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the\nnormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem\nlikely to build on that stability.\n    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement\nlast month was the main reason markets were calm.\n    But he said in an interview that financial markets also\nunderstood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures\nto be taken over a period of time in the future should foster\nstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in\nfact what has happened since Paris.\"\n    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by\nthe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and\ncease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.\n    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but\nleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.\n    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the\nagreement included a secret pact to consider further\ncoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations\nhave taken jointly several times in the past year.\n    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,\nFrance, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were\nwithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic\nconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget\ndeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.\n    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in\nfuture international talks.\n    \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand\npolitically and the stronger he is politically the better off\nwe are with the Congress and the better off we are in\ninternational fora,\" said the official, an Administration\neconomic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the\ncontinued conduct of our initiatives.\"\n    But the official also said the Administration would resist\ncalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target\nEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.\n    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to\nstop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached\n1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to\nhave intervened to curb sterling's strength.\n    International monetary sources say finance ministers and\ncentral bankers, who will review market performance and their\nown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington\njust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund.\n    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris\npact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.\n    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,\nwhile U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to\nshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.\n    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently\nwhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told\nbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if\nthe Fed was ready to follow suit.\n    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there\nhad been some change in approach on the part of the central\nbank in Germany.\n    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by\nthe Fed and the Bundesbank.\n    \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked\nabout it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who\nasked not to be identified.\n    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank\nis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the\nmajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.\nTrade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated\naction could be on the April agenda.\n REUTER...\n\u0003",

Instead, it appointed a\ncommittee of independent directors to study strategic\nalternatives for the 170-year-old firm.\n    The alternatives include continuation of the company's\nexisting business plans, possible business combinations, sales\nof stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the\ncompany.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on\nthe alternatives, Harper and Row added.\n    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a\nshare for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a\nshare from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich\nInc <HBJ>.\n    After considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday,\nthe Harper and Row board decided not to act on them.\n    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to\npreserve the company's independence and take advantage of its\n\"considerable future prospects,\" according to director Winthrop\nKnowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly\nestablished independent committee.\n    \"However, given the significant current interest in the\ncompany, we also feel that we should carefully review all the\noptions available. The committee will consider all the\npertinent facts and alternatives.... We intend to make a\ncareful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to\na conclusion,\" Knowlton said.\n    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has\npostponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that\nhad been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to\nrecapitalize the company's stock to create two classes of\nshares with different voting rights.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Production is targetted\nto increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.\n    The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met\ntheir supply obligations in January and February.\n    Production of oil, the country's main export to Western\nnations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from\n97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.\n    Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured\ninto the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse\nthe stagnation in production which began in November 1983.\n    Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline\nin Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6\nbillion in 1985.\n    Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets\nwere also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.\n    Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally\nbad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality\ncontrols imposed on enterprises.\n    Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in\nMoscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in\nFebruary but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of\nthe year compared with the same period of 1986.\n    The figures showed that five republics produced less than\nin the first two months of 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Otherwise, they\nfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions\nfor Latin borrowers will be set back.\n    \"There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks.

        "body": "Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected\nto sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three\nbillion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.\n    One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a\ndraft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future\ninterest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year\nrepayment term.\n    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.\n    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on\nTuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to\nMoscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.\n    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate\nfor trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a\nrate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar\nwhich Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official\nrate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.\n    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in\nexports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.\n    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the\ndoor for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built\nsteel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year\ndevelopment plan ending June 30 1992.\n    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint\nand glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of\ncurrently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military\nhardware, the officials said.\n    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of\nSoviet-supplied equipment, one official said.\n    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977\nwhen then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing\nally and turned to the U.S..\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The central bank will have 10 days to\ndecide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.\n    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs\ncompared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.\n    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.\n    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by\na council with members from the central bank, the economy\nministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The\ncentral bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in\naccordance with guidelines set by the council.\n    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade\nsurplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in\n1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.\n   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against\n2.97 billion in 1985.\n   Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product\ngrew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level\nregistered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in\n1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary\nestimates.\n    The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line\ndebt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3\nbillion dlr foreign debt.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Taiwan's surplus with\nthe U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.\n    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year\nlimiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.\n    Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct\nagainst the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.\n    It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking\na major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.\nDollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.\n    Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have\nbeen holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not\nclear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Philippines finance minister Jaime\nOngpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt\nrescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors,\nas he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.\n    \"One can never be too optimistic, but I'm cautiously\noptimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close\nto a deal,\" Ongpin told Reuters by telephone.\n    He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late\nFriday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other\nmembers of the Philippine delegation.\n    Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer\nand bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next\nmeeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he\ntoo was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly\nby the end of the week.\n    Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay\npart of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment\nNotes, PINs, instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory\ncommittee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the\nconcept as it was originally drafted, but the counter-proposal\nmade on Friday contains a revised version, bankers said.\n    Manila, seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total\ndebt of 27.2 billion, wants to pay the London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs.\n    These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a\ndiscount to multi-national firms which would then convert them\nat face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidized\npesos for use in funding government-approved investments.\n    Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest\nmargin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign\nexchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the\nneed to seek new bank loans.\n    But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original\nform, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.\n    They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that\ninterest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other\ndebtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.\n    Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that\nhis government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if\nthere was no buyer in the secondary market.\n    Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this,\nwhen senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with\nTreasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy.\n    But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was\nstill a sticking point.\n    After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement\nlast month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR, some New York bankers\nimediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new\nbenchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans, is current on\ninterest and is repaying some principal.\n    The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the\nthird.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

However, since\nthe end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine\nper dollar.\n    Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank\nand IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar\non the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.\n    According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by\nassistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude\nits talks with the government on schedule on March 23.\n    The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its\ntalks with the government have taken longer than expected.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The extraordinary foreign exchange\nloss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG\n<VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders were\nprobably involved in the case, currency sources said.\n    They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that\nprosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to\nFrankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.\n    Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in\nprosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency\nhedging.\n    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by\nstate prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW\ncurrency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.\n    The transactions were only possible, \"because the culprits\npossessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were\nable to deceive controllers for years,\" the newspaper said.\n    But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in\nevery bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily\nbe avoided.\n    Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,\nhas resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.\n    Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday\nthat foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed\nand Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer\ndepartment, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller,\nhead of the central cash and currency clearing.\n    Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also\nsuspended, but no charges have been laid.\n    VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said\nentire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in\nforged transactions.\n    Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers\ndiscovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW\nexpected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian\nNational Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they\nknew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were\nforgeries.\n    The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has\nnot commented on the affair.\n    The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank\nof Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders\nand most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.\n    It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to\nrenege on a genuine forward contract since this would\nimmediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from\noperating further in the spot or forward currency markets.\n    Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to\n10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the\nlonger and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it\nwould be transacted with a domestic institution.\n    Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW\nhas exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these\nwith most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through\ncurrency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing\nrelatively little hedging, currency sources said.\n    \"They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading as\na bank,\" one senior dealer said.\n    Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurred\nbecause of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contracts\nbeginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.\n    But the currency sources said market speculation was that\ndollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that\nthe bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which\ntime around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar\nfall continued.\n    Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200\nmln dlrs each were rare. Taking several in this size out with a\nsingle bank would be easily spotted by financial controllers.\n    One senior dealer for a German bank said, \"There's no way\nthey can have hoped to get away with it. It's too big.\"\n    The sources added that the involvement of the Federal\nCriminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden could indicate that the\ninvestigation would lead outside Germany.\n    BKA has the mandate to handle criminal cases that may\ninvolve foreign police forces or supranational services such as\nInterpol. However the branch also handles cases that transcend\nfederal state borders within Germany.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "German banking authorities are\nweighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an\nattempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated\ncapital market instruments, banking sources said.\n    Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are\nunder closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may\nresemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To\nJapan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of\nbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British\nproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.\n    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to\nproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.\n    \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter\nstages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in\nCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.\n    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West\nGermany's four major banking associations and the Federal\nBanking Supervisory Office.\n    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes\nwould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has\nbeen in effect since 1934.\n    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit\npresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary\npolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.\n    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited\nbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,\non a consolidated basis.\n    But lending ratios do not extend to several newer\ninstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,\ncurrency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,\ncurrency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies\nand various innovative types of interest rate hedges.\n    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals\nlay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,\nand, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps\nthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities\nagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on\nhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.\n    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of\nformulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in\nswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial\nintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.\nThis is the so-called market-to-market value.\n    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too\ncomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of\nlending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of\nthe borrowers involved, the sources said.\n    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended\nto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public\nauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign\nbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.\n    A further complication is that the more flexible\ndefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put\nGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.\n    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of\nthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.\nAnd British authorities, the sources said.\n    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated\nforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be\nbrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite\nthe fact that the risk may be entirely different.\n    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was\nuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and\napplied for a full banking licence over the last two years in\norder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\n    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending\nratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,\nparticularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they\nare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,\nthe sources added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the\nyen around its current range, a senior central bank official\ntold reporters.\n    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris\nlast month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current\nranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar\nrise.\n    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency\nstability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other\npolicies and with other central banks, he said.\n    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability\nwill continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but\ndeclined to be more specific.\n    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday\nthe current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily\nsatisfactory for the Japanese economy.\n    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the\nofficial cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a\ncompletely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.\nOr West Germany, or resumption of comments by government\nofficials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.\n    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross\nnational product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in\nthe fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little\nchanged from the performance expected this year.\n    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but\nthe external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of\nnearly one percentage point, he said.\n    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary\npolicy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance\nin the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.\n    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its\npart in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.\nThe Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the\nlast year and a half.\n    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of\ninflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.\n\"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may\nstill be wet,\" he added.\n    Liquidity among private households and especially the\ncorporate sector has increased substantially, he said.\n    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock\nexchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds\ninto the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may\ncontinue, he said.\n    The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping\nFederal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when\nhis current term expires later this year.\n    \"He's a great man,\" the official said, adding that more and\nmore people expect his reappointment.\n    Turning to exchange rates, the official said the\nsubstantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect\non reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the\nimpact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the\nU.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so\nfar it has not been very strong, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Opposition to government plans to impose\na five pct sales tax is spreading nationwide ahead of the start\nof campaigning for local elections next week, political\nanalysts said.\n    The Asahi Shimbun said 31 of the 47 prefectural assemblies\nhad so far opposed, demanded amendments to, or expressed\nwariness about the tax. Assemblymen from the ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party (LDP) have also joined the opposition against\nthe tax in 11 prefectural assemblies, the daily reported.\n    About 2,600 elections will be held on April 12 and 26 for a\nwide range of local posts, including 13 governors.\n    The sales tax is one of the main planks of Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system.\n    A close aide to Nakasone has said the sales tax issue will\nhave a minimal impact on the local elections because centrist\nparties by and large support LDP candidates in many of the\nraces for governors. In the assembly elections, even LDP\ncandidates oppose the tax, he said.\n    On March 8, the LDP lost an Upper House by-election in the\nconservative stronghold of Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan\nfor the first time in 25 years. The opposition socialist winner\ncampaigned on the single issue of the sales tax.\n    The surprise LDP defeat in Iwate, coupled with Nakasone's\nsagging popularity, has forced the party to compromise with the\nopposition and agree to postpone public hearings on the fiscal\n1987/88 budget to March 19/20 from March 13/14.\n    The opposition parties have been staging recurring\nparliamentary boycotts to show their disapproval of the sales\ntax contained in the budget. They returned to the Lower House\nBudget Committee last Friday but walked out again after a few\nhours, demanding detailed data on the tax. But parliamentary\nsources said they are expected to agree in a day or two to\ndispose of some of 29 bills the LDP will submit.\n    The bills include nine which will become extinct on March\n31 unless some action is taken, the sources said. These cover\nsuch uncontroversial topics as wages for diplomats and\nrevisions of the law covering court employees.\n    Discussion is also expected of a provisional budget to\nallow the government to continue operating while debate on the\nmain budget continues beyond the April 1 start of fiscal\n1987/88, the sources said. The provisional budget could cover\nsome 50 days and include authorisation for spending on some\npublic works. Otherwise, parliament will go into virtual recess\nuntil local elections start on April 12, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "European sugar beet plantings are\nexpected to show little change from last year, despite recent\nfirmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.\n    A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,\nso far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower\nareas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.\n    Trade analysts said their private reports give similar\nresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimate\nof stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West\nGerman sugar statistician F. O. Licht.\n    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural\nexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved\nseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.\nIn recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late\nboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing\nstarts to growing seasons.\n    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers\nwill grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world\nmarket. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area\nneeded to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and\npartial price support, respectively.\n    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week\nbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policy\ncould have serious implications for future sugar output.\n    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly\none mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as\nthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for\nthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.\n    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,\nthis could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting\nhigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future\ncut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added.\n    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota\nsugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first\nplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as last\nyear's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.\n    \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman\nsaid. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white\nsugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not\nencouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output\nlast year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00\ntonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands\nbut below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.\n    In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,\nsince planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry\nsources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still\nvalid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed\nby just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.\n    Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a\nreduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.\n    British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed\nup U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should\nyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop\nequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.\n    British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes\nof whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more\nconsistent disease-resistant seed types.\n    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty\nNowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar\nIndustry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish\nproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers to\nincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.\n    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put\nplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in\n1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.\n    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or\nGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to\nthe domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'\nassociation said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but\nsurveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially\nin the north where some farmers have switched to soya.\n    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher\nthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.\n    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a\nrecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes\ninto force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest\nDutch sugar processor, said.\n    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes\nof white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the\nNetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar\nagainst a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.\n    \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher\nthan it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar\nreally worthwhile,\" the spokesman said.\n    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting\nintentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's\nSoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.\n    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some\n95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but\ndiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic\ndemand.\n    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are\nestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.\n    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske\nSukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged\nfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.\n    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic\ndemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha\nagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar\ncompany Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.\n    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to\nlate sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987\nplantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down\nfrom 37,600 in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He also said it should fully deregulate\nits short-term money markets, develop comprehensive futures\nmarkets, further open the Tokyo Stock Exchange to foreign\nmembership and remove fixed rate brokerage commissions.\n    Binney also urged Japan to abolish Article 25 of its\nSecurities and Exchange Law which, like the U.S. Glass Steagall\nAct, separates commercial from investment banking.\n    At the same meeting Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp president\nEugene Atkinson urged Japan to fully de-regulate short-term\ninterest rates, introduce commercial paper and open long-term\ngovernment bond markets to an auction system.\n    He said Japan should allow securities firms to participate\nin foreign exchange business and develop over-the-counter stock\noptions and futures. Short-selling of Japanese government cash\nbonds was a vital hedging mechanism, he added.\n    The group of some 60 Japanese legislators and financial\nleaders which Atkinson and Binney addressed was recently formed\nto study ways in which Japan should promote liberalisation of\nits financial markets.\n    \"We should not leave such matters solely to government\nbureaucrats,\" Masao Hori, Chairman of the lower house finance\ncommittee, told the group.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "While world exchanges revel in a\ncontinuing securities boom, the Dutch stockmarket remains\nlacklustre despite a series of largely positive annual\ncorporate results and signs of a more stable dollar, analysts\nsaid.\n    Prices and turnover on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange have\nsprung back from lows reached when the dollar dipped below the\ntwo guilder mark in January. But market analysts say only lower\ninterest rates or a further rise in the dollar, now trading at\naround 2.09 guilders, could keep the momentum going.\n    \"Between end-1982 and end-1986 Dutch stocks rose by around\n150 pct, but the dollar's sharp fall last year put the brake on\nthe bull market,\" said Philip Menco, analyst with bank CLN Oyens\nen van Eeghen.\n    The dollar's current level compares with an average in 1986\nof 2.45 guilders, and 3.35 in 1985, official figures show.\n    But Arjen Los, analyst with Dutch merchant bank Pierson,\nHeldring en Pierson, sees room for some optimism,\n   \"The market is exaggerating the whole dollar affair. We've\nseen the bottom of its decline. But what is lacking is a\nstimulus on the interest rate front,\" he said.\n    Analysts said they expected little impact from provincial\nelections on Wednesday as the government's position was secure.\n    \"The scope for price rises in Dutch shares is narrow, given\nthe limited room for lower interest rates,\" said Los, adding the\nDutch market can currently only dream of returns of around 15\npct seen in rising markets elsewhere in Europe.\n    \"When the dollar slumped in the second half of 1986, U.S.\nAnd U.K investors were heavy sellers of Dutch stock. They made\nan enormous currency gain,\" Menco said.\n    Finance Ministry figures show foreign investment in Dutch\nstock last year fell by nearly half to 4.2 billion guilders.\n    Los envisaged no significant revival of foreign interest in\nthe Dutch market. He saw the large, liquid Dutch pension funds\npursuing a more aggressive portfolio management policy while\ncontinuing to invest in markets with weaker currencies.\n    Outflows of non-bank Dutch capital totalled a record 21.4\nbillion guilders last year, 12.3 billion of which stemmed from\nsecurities transactions.\n    \"Dutch institutions have been rallying to buoyant foreign\nmarkets, but this season's results could coax some of them back\nto the relatively underpriced Dutch market,\" Koos Ten Have of\nStaal Bankiers said.\n    Ten Have said Dutch price/earnings ratios based on\nforecasts of 1987 results were broadly unchanged compared with\n1986. With an average ratio of 10, they were still attractively\nlower than shares of other exchanges, he added.\n    He said the reliability of the strong guilder was a further\nfactor favouring Dutch stock investments.\n    Senior bank economists said this week's official economic\nforecast by the CPB planning agency painted a gloomy picture of\nthe Dutch economy but this would not shake investor confidence\nin the Dutch business sector. The Dutch economy was doing\nrelatively well compared with other nations, they added.\n    Analysts say most companies have fulfilled expectations,\nwhile some firms, particularly in food and publishing,\nsurprised the market with continued solid profit growth despite\nmajor dollar and sterling investments.\n    Unexpectedly positive results from companies like Unilever\nPlc-NV <UN.AS>, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> and\nHeineken NV <HEIN.AS> were balanced by poor performances by the\nthree banks, which achieved higher profits partly by reducing\ntheir risk provisions. Analysts still have doubts about the\ninsurance sector, and many companies stressed the negative\nimpact of lower currencies on their guilder earnings in 1986.\n    Food and publishing are seen as major growth areas, despite\nthe fact many of these companies have significant activities in\nthe U.K and U.S.\n    Food chain Ahold NV <AHLN.AS> reported an 8.1 pct increase\nin net 1986 profit but said it did not see profits growing in\n1987 due to the uncertainty of the dollar.\n    Turnover declined by 5.7 pct to 11.4 billion guilders.\nAbout 1.5 billion guilders of this decline was due to the lower\ndollar and one third of turnover volume was achieved in the\nU.S.\n    \"Ahold is too cautious over the dollar,\" Los said. \"As long as\nsuch companies continue to maintain their U.S. Activities and\nfund their expansion there, the negative influence is purely an\naccounting effect.\"\n    Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS> and Heineken also managed\nhandsome profit increases of 16.6 and 7.5 pct respectively,\nwhile blaming disappointing turnover in their substantial\noverseas activities on the lower dollar.\n    Initial publishing results indicate a bumper year for\nshares in this sector and ensure firm interest despite higher\nprice/earnings ratios, ranging from 12 to 14.

        "body": "Preparations for the launch of a Swiss\noptions and futures exchange, billed as the first completely\nelectronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,\naccording to members of the project team.\n    The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)\nis a new departure in that it will introduce an additional\nrange of financial instruments and electronic trading methods\nto the traditionally conservative Swiss market.\n    There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading\nand clearing systems will be completely automated.\n    The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,\nfollows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle\nand Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of\nkeen competition from London and Frankfurt.\n    These innovations included the introduction last October of\ncontinuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single\ncontinuously updated Swiss share index from next month to\nsupplement the various indices produced by the major banks at\nthe close of business, and experiments in electronic trading.\n    Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching\ncovered warrants on the shares of other Swiss companies.\n    \"If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its\ninternational prominence in portfolio management, our bankers\nand fund managers must have the same modern instruments at\ntheir disposal as their competitors,\" says Soffex president\nRudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.\n    The computer terminals on which business will be conducted\nwill be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many\nSwiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.\n    Formal applications are not due until next month but a\npreliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this\nweek showed strong interest in membership.\n    \"The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all\nover the country has been very encouraging,\" says Philippe\nBollag of the project team.\n    Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius\nBaer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost\nforeign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse\nturnover generally.\n    The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should\nattract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.\n    Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss\nbanks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.\n    Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to\n15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new\nSwiss share index should follow within six months but trading\nin financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified\nfuture date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.\n    Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating\nin the market through computer terminals in their own offices.\nTrading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.\n    Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage\nfirms with an office in Switzerland, while Clearing Members\nmust be recognised as banks under Swiss law.\n    The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp\nsoftware and hardware, provides for the display of best bid and\noffer prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous\nnegotiation of block orders and maintains members' order books.\n    An \"interest\" facility, aimed at helping participants to\ngauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a\nparticular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic\nclearing functions will be carried out overnight.\n    Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the\n100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures\nmarkets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.\n    This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost\nthousands of francs.

Hoffman-La Roche und\nCo AG <HOFZ.Z>, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were\nquoted this week at 209,000 francs each.\n    Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months\nfollowing the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,\nJuly or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in\nfuture if market liquidity permits.\n    Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas\nsuch as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory\nand regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.\n    Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were\nenthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their\nown involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.\n    \"We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will\nrequire a change in psychology,\" said a securities dealer at a\nmajor Swiss bank. \"We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all\nday at a screen where nobody shouts at you.\"\n    Moving into traded options will also require considerable\ninvestment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely\nnew dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and\nsome banks are already sending staff abroad for training.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He gave no date for the launch.\n    Ongpin said the implementation of the fund had been delayed\nby his government's negotiations to reschedule about 9.4\nbillion dlrs of its 27.8 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Craig Nalen, president of a U.S.-government backed Overseas\nPrivate Investment Corp mission which visited Manila in\nFebruary, told reporters at the time the capital fund would\namount to at least 100 mln dlrs.\n    Ongpin proposed the 250 mln dlr fund during a trip to the\nUnited States last September.\n    His plan called on private investors to raise funds to buy\ndiscounted obligations of Philippine borrowers from creditors\nand convert them to equity in local projects.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Dlr loan from its parent\ncompany to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond\nCentre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.\n    It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the\nproject, the company said.\n    The January announcement said the rights issue would\nfinance Bond Corp's 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct\nstake in HK-TVB Ltd <TVBH.HK> from film magnate Run Run Shaw.\n    The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led\nby Sino Land Co Ltd <SINO.HK> to buy a commercial complex that\nis still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.\n    Bond International said in the document that except for the\n240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal\nresources and by selling an interest in the building.\n    The payments must be completed by the end of 1987.\n    Bond International has also sold several residential\nbuildings in Hong Kong's mid-levels district for a total of\n68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.\n    The flats were among the properties it bought last year\nfrom Hongkong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HK> for 1.4 billion dlrs.\n    Analysts said Bond International is heavily geared as it\nhas relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the Hongkong\nLand properties and the HK-TVB shares.\n    Bond International also said in the document that while it\nplans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the\nHK-TVB shares as a long-term investment.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Philippine government revenue is\nexpected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from\n79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.\n    In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's\nperformance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at\nleast 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax\nreform measures announced last year.\n    He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)\nthis year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have\ncommitted ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct\nfrom 1.3 billion in 1986.\n    Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base\nincluded a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in\n1988. He gave no other details.\n    He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and\nthe volume of government securities sold to the private sector\nhave improved significantly. \"In particular, short-term prime\ninterest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down\nto less than 10 pct,\" he said.\n    Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced\nin August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth\nof applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in\napprovals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.\n    He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation\nprogram and the sale of non-performing assets owned by\nassociates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a\n1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help\nfinance land reform.\n    Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion\npesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed\ncompanies will be used to finance the land reform plan.\n    Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to\nobtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program\nfrom a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and\nbilateral aid donors.\n    The government has said the land reform plan aims to\ndistribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Ecuador\nhas an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.\n    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first\nweek of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to\noutput from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of\nits total production into floating storage.\n    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the\ntelevision news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,\nincluding Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.\n    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan\noil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with\nits 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower\nthan that.\n    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially\nstopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March\nbecause Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still\nlifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a\nfurther 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\"\n    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only\n2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift\nat official prices.\n    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member\ncountries calling for the formation of a committee to study\nwhat it said were inequalities in marketing potential among\nvarious members.\n    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was\nhaving difficulty selling crude at official prices.\n    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries\nexport substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC\nprice regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude\non which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and\n\"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals\nwith crude oil.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Ministry sources said the Ministry has\nyet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing\nthe perpetual floating rate notes they hold.\n    The notes are held by Japanese city, trust, long-term and\nregional banks, including their overseas branches.\n    Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset\nportfolios on the basis of current market prices while the\nothers assess them at either the acquisition cost or the\ncurrent market price, whichever is lower, bankers said.\n    With the market for such perpetuals non-existent, Finance\nMinistry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal\nquotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine\nbank book losses.\n    The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the\nNational Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using\nsuch quotations, one official said.\n    Banks using current market prices alone to value their\nholdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue\nthat the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next\nyear, bankers said.\n    But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign\nportfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said. The\nacquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price,\nwhatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in the\ncurrent fiscal year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The credibility of government efforts to\nstabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the\ntest over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a\nbuffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government\ndelegates and trade experts said.\n    Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when\nInternational Coffee Organization members failed to agree on\nhow coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many\nof the same experts gather in the same building here to try to\nagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.\n    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the\nInternational Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses\nrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting\na shadow over commodity negotiations.\n    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to\ncompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts\nwith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear\nlines drawn between aid and trade.\n    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic\nelements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in\nGeneva at the weekend.\n    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa\nOrganization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with\nquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to\nbe bought. One consumer country delegate said this would\n\"distort, not support\" the market.\n    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO\nfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee\nprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can\nfounder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\nfutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\nalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.\n    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\n\"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\nwhich came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\nwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\n    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\noperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\nlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\ncannot operate on futures markets.\n    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\nselling operations, were carried forward from the previous\nagreement.\n    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\nall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\n    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\nbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\nover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\npay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\ngroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\nmatters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\n    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\nshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\ncountries such as Malaysia.\n    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\nstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\nmanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\n    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\nto the one over differentials for different qualities.\n    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\ncompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\nrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\nmarket's existing differentials for different qualities.\n    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\nthe London market.\n    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\nstg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\n    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\noperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\nhighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\n    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\nEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\nsiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\nin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\nand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\namong the 12 nations.\n    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\nflexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\nwill be able to respond if they are there.\n    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\nsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\nbacks the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\nmarket where trade buying is not.\"\n    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\ncocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\n    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\nwhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\n\"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\nbuying then accepting offers.\n    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\nproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\ncocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\nway that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But contamination would be within the permissible\nlimits, Sytnik said.\n    The banks of the river Pripyat, which flows near the plant,\nhad been reinforced to prevent it bursting its banks when the\nthaw began this spring, he added.\n    About 135,000 people were evacuated and 31 were killed\nafter an explosion and fire at Chernobyl last April 26. A\nconcrete wall was built last summer to prevent contamination of\nthe Pripyat by radioactive ground water.\n    Meanwhile, a Ukrainian official was quoted as saying today\nthat preparations were under way in the Ukraine to evacuate\ntowns and villages before there was heavy flooding after higher\nthan usual snowfall this winter.\n    V. Martynenko, head of a flood commission in the Donbass\narea of the Ukraine, told Pravda preparations had begun for the\nevacuation of about 112,000 people in the Donbass in the south\nof the republic. About 190 towns and villages and 12,000 homes\ncould be flooded when snow -- falls of which had been six times\nhigher than usual in some areas -- started to thaw. Cattle had\nalready been moved from some parts, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The head of a Philippine panel charged\nwith recovering illegal wealth accumulated by former President\nFerdinand Marcos and his associates said they still controlled\nlarge funds circulating in the country's economy.\n    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good\nGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters in an interview: \"There is every\nreason to believe that the cronies and President Marcos and his\nfamily were able to hide millions and millions of pesos before\nthey fled. As a matter of fact we have been able to get hold of\ncrates of newly printed currency.\"\n    Diaz did not give figures, but said: \"We believe they still\nhave a lot of funds. These are the funds that they will use in\nthe coming elections. These are the funds that they used to\nstage those coups.\"\n    He was referring to congressional elections scheduled for\nMay 11 and to the three coup attempts faced by President\nCorazon Aquino since she toppled Marcos a year ago.\n    Diaz said the PCGG so far has recovered cash and property\nvalued at about eight billion pesos and had sequestered shares\nof stock of at least 286 firms. \"We have achieved more than what\nwe thought we could achieve in one year,\" he added.\n    The government last week announced that businessman Antonio\nFloirendo, an associate of Marcos known as the \"banana king,\" had\nturned over 70 mln pesos in cash to the PCGG and promised to\nsurrender titles to property in New York and Hawaii worth\nanother 180 mln pesos. In return, the PCGG said it had lifted\nfreeze and sequestration orders on Floirendo's properties.\n    Diaz said there were already similar preliminary agreements\nwith another Marcos associate, Roberto Benedicto. He said\nBenedicto had surrendered control of several newspapers and\nradio and television stations and agreed to PCGG control of the\nboards of a bank and a hotel he owned in the Philippines.\n    Diaz said the PCGG based its estimates of illegal wealth on\nincome-tax returns and land titles of Marcos associates.\n\"Anything over and above reported income -- that's what we have\nto recover,\" he said.\n    He said a decision by the PCGG last week to probe street\ncertificates held by brokers at Manila's two stock exchanges\nwas prompted by suspicion that illegal funds were in\ncirculation.\n    Street certificates describe securities held in the name of\na broker or another nominee instead of a customer so as to\npermit easy trading or transfer.\n Reuter...\n\u0003",

Otherwise, they\nfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions\nfor Latin borrowers will be set back.\n    \"There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel\nit's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a\nrestructuring would look bad,\" one banker commented.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the\nyen around its current range, a senior central bank official\ntold reporters.\n    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris\nlast month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current\nranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar\nrise.\n    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency\nstability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other\npolicies and with other central banks, he said.\n    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability\nwill continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but\ndeclined to be more specific.\n    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday\nthe current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily\nsatisfactory for the Japanese economy.\n    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the\nofficial cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a\ncompletely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.\nOr West Germany, or resumption of comments by government\nofficials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.\n    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross\nnational product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in\nthe fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little\nchanged from the performance expected this year.\n    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but\nthe external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of\nnearly one percentage point, he said.\n    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary\npolicy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance\nin the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.\n    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its\npart in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.\nThe Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the\nlast year and a half.\n    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of\ninflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.\n\"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may\nstill be wet,\" he added.\n    Liquidity among private households and especially the\ncorporate sector has increased substantially, he said.\n    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock\nexchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds\ninto the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may\ncontinue, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer\nsaid OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18\ndlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there\nwas no immediate need to change it.\n    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news\nagency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three\nmln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC\nquota.\n    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will\ncontinue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members\nadhere to the pact, Nazer said.\n    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production\nceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices\naveraging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.\n    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki\nYamani last October, said: \"I do not foresee any need for new\nmeasures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting\nwill take place as scheduled.\"\n    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all\nmembers were abiding by its agreements.\n    \"We've heard news every now and then of violations but they\nwere not at all verified,\" he said.\n    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a\n13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near\n18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.\n    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but\nhave firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as\ntraders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.\n    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its\n4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.\n    \"As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as\ndevised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to\nthe agreement,\" he said.\n    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the\nNeutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating\nstorage, Nazer said.\n    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and\nVisnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price\nstability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful\ncompetition with OPEC.\n    \"Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly\ndesires price stability,\" he said.\n    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had\nreturned to a role of \"swing producer\" within OPEC.\n    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln\nbpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and\nover-production by some OPEC states.\n    \"Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played\nby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8\nmln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other\nmembers of OPEC,\" Nazer said.\n    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third\nquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.\n    But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the\nOPEC members will consult with each other and take the\nnecessary measures.\"\n    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when\ndemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern\nhemisphere spring and summer.\n    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation\nfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union\nagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after\nhe visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.\n    \"We did not ask any country to do anything. These were\nprogrammes they thought were necessary to stabilise market\nconditions and to help themselves attain better pricing\nconditions,\" Nazer said.\n    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate\n-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if\nthey saw fit.\n\u0003",

The fluctuating official\nrate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.\n    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in\nexports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.\n    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the\ndoor for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built\nsteel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year\ndevelopment plan ending June 30 1992.\n    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint\nand glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of\ncurrently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military\nhardware, the officials said.\n    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of\nSoviet-supplied equipment, one official said.\n    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977\nwhen then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing\nally and turned to the U.S..\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The central bank will have 10 days to\ndecide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.\n    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs\ncompared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.\n    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.\n    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by\na council with members from the central bank, the economy\nministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The\ncentral bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in\naccordance with guidelines set by the council.\n    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade\nsurplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in\n1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.\n   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against\n2.97 billion in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Existing 500-franc \"B\"\ntranche certificates would be split five-for-one.\n    The split would improve the marketability of the existing\ncertificates, chief executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told a news\nconference.\n    The new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs,\ncompared with a closing price last Friday of 3,325 on the\nZurich Stock Exchange, while the registered shares would be\nissued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Britain and West Germany told their\nEuropean Community partners they would strongly oppose major\nelements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.\n    At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a\nfull debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has\nalready angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led\nprotests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.\n    West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will\nadvise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance\nother proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.\n    They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter\nthis weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the\npresident of the EC's Executive Commission which had put\nforward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC\ncash crisis.\n    Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals\nproduction curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a\nproposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) -\na system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out\nforeign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.\n    Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German\nfarmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to\nexport to weaker currency states, which means virtually all\nother 11 EC states, diplomats said.\n    Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose\na hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it\ncould seriously damage EC trade relations.\n    The diplomats said the United States had been the most\noutspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it\nas a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body\nGATT.\n    But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC,\nsuch as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina,\nIceland and Norway, they added.\n    Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm\nreform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that\ncould spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.\n    Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on\neither the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today,\ndiplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that\nneither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for\nsubstantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this\nmonth, they added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Instead, it appointed a\ncommittee of independent directors to study strategic\nalternatives for the 170-year-old firm.\n    The alternatives include continuation of the company's\nexisting business plans, possible business combinations, sales\nof stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the\ncompany.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on\nthe alternatives, Harper and Row added.\n    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a\nshare for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a\nshare from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich\nInc <HBJ>.\n    After carefully considering the two offers at a meeting on\nFriday, the Harpers and Row board decided not to act on them.\n    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to\npreserve the company's independence and take advantage of its\n\"considerable future prospects,\" according to director Winthrop\nKnowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly\nestablished independent committee.\n    \"However, given the significant current interest in the\ncompany, we also feel that we should carefully review all the\noptions available. The committee will consider all the\npertinent facts and alternatives... We intend to make a careful\nand informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to a\nconclusion,\" Knowlton said.\n    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has\npostponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that\nhad been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to\nrecapitalize the company's stock in order to create two classes\nof shares with different votinmg rights.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leading industrial nations will meet\nagain next month to review their accord on currency stability,\nbut U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now\nthe countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic\ngrowth.\n    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly\nsuggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the\nnormally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem\nlikely to build on that stability.\n    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement\nlast month was the main reason markets were calm.\n    But he said in an interview that financial markets also\nunderstood, \"That all six countries concluded that the measures\nto be taken over a period of time in the future should foster\nstability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in\nfact what has happened since Paris.\"\n    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by\nthe decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and\ncease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.\n    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but\nleft room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.\n    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the\nagreement included a secret pact to consider further\ncoordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations\nhave taken jointly several times in the past year.\n    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,\nFrance, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were\nwithin ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic\nconditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget\ndeficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.\n    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future\ninternational talks.\n    \"I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand\npolitically and the stronger he is politically the better off\nwe are with the Congress and the better off we are in\ninternational fora,\" said the official, an Administration\neconomic policymaker. \"So it would be beneficial to the\ncontinued conduct of our initiatives.\"\n    But the official also said the Administration would resist\ncalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target\nEuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.\n    Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret \nshort-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific\nagreement to defend those bands with intervention.\n    According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to\n1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.\n    There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were\nset, although the agreement used the term \"ranges\", for the first\ntime in an international economic agreement.\n    The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to\nfoster currency stability around current levels.\n    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to\nstop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached\n1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to\nhave intervened to curb sterling's strength.\n    International monetary sources say finance ministers and\ncentral bankers, who will review market performance and their\nown economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington\njust before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund.\n    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris\npact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.\n    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,\nwhile U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to\nshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.\n    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently\nwhen Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told\nbankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if\nthe Fed was ready to follow suit.\n    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there\nhad been some change in approach on the part of the central\nbank in Germany.\n    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by\nthe Fed and the Bundesbank.\n    \"If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked\nabout it, it would no longer be private,\" said the official, who\nasked not to be identified.\n    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank\nis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the\nmajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.\nTrade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated\naction could be on the April agenda.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Philippines finance minister Jaime\nOngpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt\nrescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors,\nas he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.\n    \"One can never be too optimistic, but I'm cautiously\noptimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close\nto a deal,\" Ongpin told Reuters by telephone.\n    He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late\nFriday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other\nmembers of the Philippine delegation.\n    Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer\nand bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next\nmeeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he\ntoo was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly\nby the end of the week.\n    Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay\npart of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment\nNotes, PINs, instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory\ncommittee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the\nconcept as it was originally drafted, but the counter-proposal\nmade on Friday contains a revised version, bankers said.\n    Manila, seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total\ndebt of 27.2 billion, wants to pay the London Interbank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs.\n    These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a\ndiscount to multi-national firms which would then convert them\nat face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidized\npesos for use in funding government-approved investments.\n    Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest\nmargin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign\nexchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the\nneed to seek new bank loans.\n    But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original\nform, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.\n    They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that\ninterest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other\ndebtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.\n    Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that\nhis government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if\nthere was no buyer in the secondary market.\n    Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this,\nwhen senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with\nTreasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy.\n    But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was\nstill a sticking point.\n    After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement\nlast month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR, some New York bankers\nimediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new\nbenchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans, is current on\ninterest and is repaying some principal.\n    The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the\nthird.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffs\nand management overtures for wage concessions have set the\nstage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,\nanalysts and labor leaders say.\n    The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts to\nrevive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,\nEastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to its\nnon-union sister airlines, analysts said.\n    \"It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if things\nget bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting them\nover Continental Airlines,\" said Louis Marckesano, an analyst\nfor Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.\n    Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts see\nlittle chance of the carrier returning to profitability this\nyear.\n    Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Air\nlast year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees has\nplummeted, workers and labor leaders say.\n    Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that morale\nproblems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline in\ncustomer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.\n    Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many of\nthem newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- of\nconducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at\nridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.\n    \"It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people out\nin an attempt to cut the company's labor costs,\" said Nancy\nTauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.\n    Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalked\nby what they call \"spyriders\" -- teams of auditors they say\nhave been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretly\nexamine flight crew performance.\n    Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flight\nattendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some for\nhaving as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales and\nmovie headset rentals, Tauss said.\n    Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tightening\nits accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,\nwhich the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the \nhighest in the industry.\n    But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-base\nairline was using unfair labor tactics. \"We're just trying to\ncorrect long-standing problems and that causes some\ndissatisfaction,\" he said.\n    U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met with\ngroups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and is\nreported to have told them he may call for hearings on the\nairline's labor tactics.\n    Labor and management have a long history of bitter\nrelations at Eastern Airlines.\n    But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,\nwhen Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of\n490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly through\nunion concessions.\n    Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands for\nwage cuts and have refused to open their contracts for\nrenegotiation.\n    Union officials say that in retaliation for their\nresistance, the airline has launched a \"firing frenzy\" aimed at\nintimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.\n    During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumed\ncontrol of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.  That\nwas nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said. In the\nfirst two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing their\njobs, according to union records.\n    Other unions report similar losses.\n    Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern's\nwide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.\n    Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repair\nits planes in several cities and plans to shut down some\nmaintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.\n    \"Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern to\nunderwrite an outmoded labor cost structure,\" Bakes told a\nmeeting of Miami businessmen this month. He denied, however,\nthat Lorenzo planned to strip Eastern of its assets.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Analysts\nestimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct of\ntheir total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.\n    At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier this\nmonth, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscript\ntypesetting language in future electronic printing products.\nIBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windows\noperating environment as the graphics interface standard in\nfuture publishing announcements rather than its own Topview\nenvironment.\n    \"IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to the\ndevelopment of the desktop publishing market,\" said David\nGoodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.\n    \"It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products that\nare already available without being afraid that they will not\nbe compatible with whatever IBM does,\" he said.\n    The advent of personal computers, laser printers and\ngraphics software has allowed users to design and print\nbrochures, newsletters and a host of other communications at\ntheir desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printing\nfirm. Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktop\npublishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computer\nfour years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellent\ngraphics capabilities.\n     Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, Apollo\nComputer Inc and a number of other vendors have identified\ndesktop publishing as a major growth area. IBM entered the\nmarket only last July when it formed its Publishing Systems\nBusiness Unit. IBM's embrace of the already-widely used\nPostscript, a language that interprets computer commands and\ntranslates them into instructions for the printer, was an\nacknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.\n    Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems said\nthe support of the world's largest computer maker was critical\nto the language's ultimate acceptance by users.\n    John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,\nsaid, \"Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktop\npublishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for an\nIBM announcement.\"\n    IBM entered a licensing pact with Adobe for Postscript, but\nits support of Windows was not quite so broad. IBM recognizes\nWindows as a standard but would not comment on the extent of\nits commitment to the software.\n    Windows, a program integrator, allows personal computer\nusers to run a number of different applications simultaneously.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Debt securities issued by major U.S.\nbanks are under pressure in the secondary market as investors\nshy away from the paper because of Brazil's suspension of\ninterest payments last month, analysts and traders said.\n    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest\npayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks.\nNo date was established for the renewal of payments.\n    \"Buyers have backed away from bank paper. These securities\nhave become very difficult to sell despite a rise in their\nyields,\" said one corporate bond trader.\n    \"Debt issues of major money center banks will probably\ncontinue to trade off until such time as the Brazil situation\nis resolved,\" said Loretta Neuhaus, a vice president with\nMerrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    \"I have not told any of our investors to stay away from the\nbanks in general,\" she added. \"But I have not received too many\ninquiries by prospective buyers lately either.\"\n    Traders said debt securities of U.S. banks that are\nperceived by investors to be heavily exposed to Latin American\ndebtor nations declined moderately in price last week. They\nsaid the difference between bids and offers widened.\n    \"There is not much trading of bank issues these days,\" an\nunderwriter said, referring to the wider bid/offer spreads.\n    However, he and others pointed out that the secondary\nmarket has not seen heavy selling by institutions, funds and\nother investors.\n    \"The selling has been steady over the past couple of weeks.\nBut it has been far from panicky,\" said another trader.\n    In addition, institutional sources told Reuters on Friday\nthat Salomon Brothers Inc lowered its investment ratings on the\nstocks of all U.S. money centers. But the sources said it is\nunderstood the action is not a sell recommendation.\n    While institutional sources said Salomon lowered the\nratings to M from O-plus on bank stocks, bond traders said this\ncarried over to the secondary market and further undermined\nconfidence in bank paper.\n    The banks affected by Salomon's change in investment coding\nwere Bank of New York Co Inc <BK>, Bankers Trust Co <BT>, Chase\nManhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Citicorp\n<CCI>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>,\nJ.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>,\nRepublic New York Corp <RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and\nFirst Chicago Corp <FNB>, sources said.\n    The institutional sources said Salomon cited a filing with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission by Citibank, the lead\nbank of Citicorp.\n    Citibank said Friday it told the SEC its earnings could be\nreduced by 50 mln dlrs after-tax in the first quarter, and 190\nmln dlrs in the year, if it has to declare 3.9 billion dlrs of\nmedium- and long-term Brazilian loans non-performing.\n    \"I believe there will be some renegotiation along the way\nbetween Brazil and the banks such that the banks will not have\nto charge off their loans to Brazil,\" Merrill Lynch's Neuhaus\ncommented.\n    But until then, investors are widely expected to remain\nleery of buying bank paper, according to analysts and traders.\n    In an unrelated development, RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR> paid\nwhat some bond traders said amounted to a \"penalty fee\" when\nthe company tapped the domestic debt market on Friday.\n    RJR Nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of sinking fund debentures\ndue 2017 via lead manager Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The\ndebentures had an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at 98.675 to\nyield 8-3/4 pct, or 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4\npct Treasury bonds of 2016. The yield and premium over\nTreasuries was greater than a similar financing in January.\n    On January 22 Nabisco sold 500 mln dlrs of same-maturity,\nsame-rated sinking fund debentures priced to yield 8.62 pct, or\n107 basis points over the 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds.\n    Both issues were rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S and P.\n    Bond traders noted that Nabisco has called for redemption\naround 1.2 billion dlrs of its 11.20 pct notes of 1997. Nabisco\nwill buy them back at 107.50, traders said.\n    \"The redemption of an attractive double-digit yield issues\nhas tainted Nabisco in investors' eyes,\" said one trader.\n\"Obviously, a lot of prospective buyers believe Nabisco should\npay a higher yield because of that.\"\n    Traders also asserted that the higher yield in Friday's\npricing reflected the total debt issuance of one billion dlrs\nso far this year by Nabisco.\n    \"Investors may be showing some signs of indigestion,\"\nremarked one trader. Traders said they expect Nabisco will\nfloat more debt in the coming weeks to finance the redemption\nof the 11.20 pct notes.\n    Officers on Shearson's syndicate desk declined to comment.\n    IDD Information Service said the 30-day corporate visible\nsupply rose to 3.28 billion dlrs last week from 1.79 billion\ndlrs in the previous week.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He also said there was no\nsign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia.\n    A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil\nto Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this\nmonth and other vessels had been earmarked for April.\n    Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for\nIndonesia but would not disclose tonnages.\n    Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had\nbeen below expectations and current stocks were low. They said\nlicences were issued at the start of the year to import crude\npalm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and\nRBD oil.\n    Last week there were rumours in European markets that\nIndonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes\nof palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian\nMinistry of Trade official said this was incorrect.\n    Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said\nthey could include those issued earlier this year and\napplications not yet granted.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A year after squeezing to power with a\nnarrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques\nChirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations\nchoking the French economy.\n    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial\nrecovery the government says will follow from its free market\npolicies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But\nso is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year\nand the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct\nin 1986, is uncertain.\n    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth\ntarget and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister\nEdouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But\nsome government supporters say they fear time for an economic\nmiracle may be running out.\n    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential\nelections due by April next year.\n    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of\nright-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed\nreviews from non-partisan analysts.\n    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at\nnewly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding\nachievement has been to launch \"a veritable intellectual\nrevolution\" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of\nstate control.\n    \"The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --\nbut set in their context of structural reforms, they are\nexcellent,\" Develle said.\n    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief\narchitect of the government's free market policies, may be\npursuing a mirage.\n    \"The belief that economic liberalism will produce an\nexplosion of economic forces is ideological\" said Indosuez chief\neconomist Jean Cheval. \"Personally I think it's an illusion.\nDirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,\nfrom school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\"\n    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.\nOver the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls\nhave been largely abolished, labour regulations have been\npruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely\npopular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks\nand industries to private investors.\n    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have\nbought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass\nmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state\ncompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion\nfranc five-year privatisation plan.\n    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of\ncapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has\nflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift\nthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since\nDecember.\n    At the end of last year the government abolished price\ncontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as car\nrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small\nbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.\n    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices\nin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the\nofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or\nless.\n    \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you\nconsider that prices are now free for the first time since\n1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas.\n    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's\nforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1\nbillion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and\ndown from 153.3 billion in 1985.\n    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a\ngradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French\nfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating\nthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second\nsince Chirac took power.\n    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development pilloried French industry for\nfailing to produce the goods that its potential customers\nwanted.\n    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology\nsectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted\nto demand\" and over-priced, the report said.\n    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed\nwith the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is\nthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and\nmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like\nfreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said.\n    And despite rising industrial investment and the\nintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,\nthe end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7\nmillion, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.\n    The problem for the government is that there may be little\nmore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.\n    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of\nlast year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the\nshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like\nWest Germany and Japan, they say.\n REUTER...\n\u0003",

A jury trial has been requested.\n    \"The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt\nthe little guy,\" said Eischen.\n    The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized\na steering committee.\n    The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from\nMarch 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between\n19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to\n16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.\n    The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from\nproceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also\nrequests damages to be determined at the time of trial.\n    Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had\nno comment on the suit.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "With the April 15 tax return deadline\nless than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging\non H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.\n    Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are\nexpected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a\n\"bonanza,\" analysts say.\n    \"For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice\nPresident Tom Bloch said in an interview. \"When Congress\ndrastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers\nbenefit,\" Bloch said.\n    \"Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place\nthem side by side to compare them, more people will throw their\nhands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'\" he said.\n\"Tax forms will look very different next year,\" he added.\n    Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's\nfiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over\nfiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on\nrevenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987\nearnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.\n    \"Next year, Block could have a bonanza,\" Buchbinder said.\nBased on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a\ngain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In\nthe 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,\nup 1.5 pct over the previous year.\n    The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln\nindividual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax\nseason, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax\npreparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according\nto the IRS.\n    For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring\nclients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,\nthere are some changes in the act that will have a negative\neffect, Bloch conceded.\n    Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax\nreturn, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In\naddition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the\ntax rolls, he said.\n    Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to\noffset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost\nfor each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73\ndlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up\nabout three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he\nsaid.\n    Block expects \"some expansion\" this tax season of its\nelectronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and\ncan speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by\nhow much it wants to expand into the seven cities made\navailable for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.\n    The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly\nfiled this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in\nthe 1986 tax season.\n    First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block\nwill benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.\n    Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the\nsame as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for\ntelevision ads. \"They may get a little more bang for their\nbuck,\" he said.\n    He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its\nbalance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could\nbe of great benefit to them.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a\nshowdown between protectionists and free traders as a major\ntrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the\nfull House of Representatives in late April.\n    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key\nHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of\nlegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against\nforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.\n    This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts\nto restore competitiveness of American industries and turn\naround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.\n    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too\nmany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back\namendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade\nagreements or keep out U.S. products.\n     On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance\nto free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in\ntrade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating\npowers.\n    Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's\nbill was not one \"that a free trader like me could endorse in\nall respects,\" but he emphasized there was a consensus among\ntrade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans\nwould ultimately endorse.\n    Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, \"to make our\ntrade policy stronger without violating our international trade\nagreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not\ndone the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't\navoided violating agreements.\"\n    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful\nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would\nhurt the U.S. economy.\n    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois\nDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if\nthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.\n    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a\ntough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this\nyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he\nsaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.\n    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman\nMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still\ndid not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel\nvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\n    The first battle will take place next week when the full\nHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\nRichard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such\nas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses\nwith the United States.\n    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\nthat the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\nStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\nbut would not automatically set off retaliation.\n    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free\ntrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.\n    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from\nimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.\nAFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the\nadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would\nsign would not be worth passage in Congress.\n    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a\nstatement, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane\nKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed\nby the president.\"\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold\noff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect\nthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan\nvetoed a similar measure last year.\n    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the\nmost influential proponents of aid for specific industries\nbeset by low priced foreign competition.\n    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the\ndomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate\nplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports\nreach half of domestic consumption.\n    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.\nenforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration\nto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as\ndumping products in the United States at prices below the cost\nof production.\n    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an\nindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens its\nexistence. Congressmen said the change would have required the\nU.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car\nimports in 1981.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Endotronics Inc said it expects to\nincur \"substantial losses\" for the second quarter ending March\n31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.\n    As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics\ncited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <Yamaha\nInc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.\n    In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts\nreceivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another\nJapanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.\n    Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations\nit will exhaust all currently available cash and credit\nfacilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of\nthe remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit\nfrom Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp\n<CZ>.\n    The company said its ability to obtain funding was\nadversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its\nshareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against\nthree officers of Endotronics.\n    Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges\nviolations of the federal securities laws in connection with\nstatements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.\n    The company also said the Securities Division of the\nMinnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into\nthe company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by\ninsiders and brokers in the company's common shares.\n    It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will\nhurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.\n    As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory\nnote, the law suit challenging its financial data and the\nvarious investigations concerning insider trading, the company\nsaid it no longer expects that anticipated declines in\ninstrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by\nincreased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the\nUnited States.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

That meeting\nended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.\n    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether\nthe 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their\ndifferences at this month's meeting.\n    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an\ninformal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among\nproducers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.\n    The key issues to be addressed at this council session\nwhich divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should\nbe eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price\ndifferentials the buffer stock should pay for different types\nof cocoa, delegates said.\n    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be\nable to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.\n    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and\nconsuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke\nup into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a\nconsumer meeting.\n    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a\nvariety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being\naccepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group\nmeeting this afternoon.\n    \"We are waiting to see what consumers say,\" a producer\ndelegate said. \"We hope they will be flexible or it will be\ndifficult to negotiate.\"\n    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries.

        "body": "Preparations for the launch of a Swiss\noptions and futures exchange, billed as the first completely\nelectronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage,\naccording to members of the project team.\n    The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex)\nis a new departure in that it will introduce an additional\nrange of financial instruments and electronic trading methods\nto the traditionally conservative Swiss market.\n    There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading\nand clearing systems will be completely automated.\n    The new market, due to start operating in January 1988,\nfollows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle\nand Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of\nkeen competition from London and Frankfurt.\n    These innovations included the introduction last October of\ncontinuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single\ncontinuously updated Swiss share index from next month to\nsupplement the various indices produced by the major banks at\nthe close of business, and experiments in electronic trade.\n    Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching\ncovered warrants on shares of other Swiss companies.\n    \"If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its\ninternational prominence in portfolio management, our bankers\nand fund managers must have the same modern instruments at\ntheir disposal as their competitors,\" says Soffex president\nRudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.\n    The computer terminals on which business will be conducted\nwill be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many\nSwiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.\n    Formal applications are not due until next month but a\npreliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this\nweek showed strong interest in membership.\n    \"The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all\nover the country has been very encouraging,\" says Philippe\nBollag of the project team.\n    Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius\nBaer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost\nforeign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse\nturnover generally.\n    The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should\nattract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.\n    Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss\nbanks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.\n    Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to\n15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new\nSwiss share index should follow within six months but trading\nin financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified\nfuture date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.\n    Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating\nin the market through computer terminals in their own offices.\nTrading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.\n    Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage\nfirms with an office in Switzerland, while clearing members\nmust be recognised as banks under Swiss law.\n    The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp\nsoftware and hardware, provides display of best bid and offer\nprices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous\nnegotiation of block orders and maintains member order books.\n    An \"interest\" facility, aimed at helping participants to\ngauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a\nparticular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic\nclearing functions will be carried out overnight.\n    Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the\n100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures\nmarkets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.\n    This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost\nthousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffmann-La Roche und\nCo AG, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quoted\nthis week at 209,000 francs each.\n    Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months\nfollowing the trading date plus the subsequent January, April,\nJuly or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in\nfuture if market liquidity permits.\n    Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas\nsuch as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory\nand regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.\n    Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were\nenthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their\nown involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.\n    \"We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will\nrequire a change in psychology,\" said a securities dealer at a\nmajor Swiss bank. \"We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all\nday at a screen where nobody shouts at you.\"\n    Moving into traded options will also require considerable\ninvestment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely\nnew dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and\nsome banks are already sending staff abroad for training.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

What we want now is to kill it\nonce and for all,\" Bennett added.\n    Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.\nGovernment has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate\nwith penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he\nsaid.\n    The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight\nthe proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.\n    U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for\none-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion\ndlrs a year, Bennett said.\n    The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers\nbadly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of\nsoyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other\nhigher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax,\nhe added.\n    The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to\nfinance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.\n    \"We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat\nthe Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and\nwatch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC\nmeasures,\" Bennett said.\n    \"The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist,\nand the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,\"\nhe added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Monetary System marks its\neighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money\nmarkets despite creating an island of currency rate stability\nin Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,\nwhich holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\nfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\n    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\nbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\nseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\n    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\nEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\nwhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.\n    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\nblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's\nfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\nformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.\n    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\nafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\ntransferred from national governments and central banks to an\nautonomous European Monetary Fund.\n    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\neconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\nthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\nsituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\neconomist who has closely watched the system's development.\n    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\nthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\nsystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\n    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\ninvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\nrise of the West German mark severely strained the system.\n    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\nabout the chances for any fundamental change.\n    \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS\nagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\nmust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\nde Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.\n    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend\nlargely on the success of an agreement last month among major\nindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar\nresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they\npredict.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Congressional investigators of the\nIran-contra scandal have tentatively agreed to grant immunity\nfrom prosecution to a star witness --President Reagan's former\nnational security adviser John Poindexter, congressional\nsources said today.\n    Sources told Reuters the chief counsels of the two special\ncommittees probing the two-year episode that has darkened the\nWhite House image plan to take their preliminary accord to\ncourt-appointed special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, possibly\ntoday or tomorrow.\n    The tentative accord follows weeks of negotiating with\nWalsh and with committee members.\n   Poindexter would be the highest ranking official to be\ngranted immunity in the investigations of the 1985-1986 arms\nsales to Iran to gain release of hostages held in Lebanon and\nthe clandestine shifting of arms profits to arm U.S.-backed\nrebels in Nicaragua, at a time aid would have been illegal.\n    If the agreement --reached on Friday by Arthur Liman and\nJohn Nields, chief legal advisors of the Senate and House\ncommittees respectively --is ratified as expected by Walsh and\nthe full committees, closed door interviews could be held with\nPoindexter in two months with public testimony in about 90 days\nor mid June, sources said.\n    \"They have tentatively reached an agreement and are supposed\nto meet with Walsh or his deputies,\" a source told Reuters of\nthe deliberations by the two chief counsels\n    Sources said Poindexter could assist investigators\ndetermine what Reagan knew about the diversion of funds from\narms sales to Iran to rebels in Nicaragua, if anything.\n    Reagan has denied knowing about the shift of funds although\nhe has admitted he gave orders to sell arms through Israel in\neither August or after the first shipment in September 1985,\nbut can't remember when. Congress was kept in the dark about\nthe affair until last autumn.\n    \"He will be a credible witness,\" one source said of the\npipe-smoking Poindexter. \n    Besides Reagan's knowledge, or lack of it, another key\nunanswered questions lingering from earlier congressional\ninvestigators and a special presidential review board, is who\nreceived  millions of dollars from clandestine arms profits.  \n    So far the money trail uncovered by probers stops at secret\nSwiss and Cayman Islands bank accounts.\n    The committees have been privately negotiating with Walsh\nover the immunity matter, and the prosecutor, also called an\nindependent counsel, has been urging the committees to hold off\non their request for at least 90 days.\n    Under the tentative accord, the wishes of Walsh could be\nmet since public testimony is not expected before 90 days.\n    Poindexter, a Navy vice admiral, along with his fired\ndeputy at the National Security Council, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver\nNorth, have refused to testify before investigators,\nclaiming their fifth amendment rights against self\nincrimination.\n    Yesterday, Vice President George Bush said in a a\ntelevision interview that he disagreed with Maureen about court\nmartials, but he too disclaimed any details of diverted funds.\n    So far, granting immunity to compel testimony from\nreluctant witnesses has been granted to five persons--with the\nkey figure so far, shadowy California international arms\nmerchant Albert Hakim.\n    Also, getting immunity has been North's attractive personal\nsecretary, Fawn Hall, who was said to have assisted North in\nshredding documents in his White House basement office after\nthe scandal broke.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange\ncontrols to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with\nEuropean Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the\nending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.\n    \"The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift\nrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with\nderegulation in the banking industry,\" he said in a telephone\ninterview.\n    The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls\nhighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.\n    The central bank said in a statement the measures included\nincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision\nfor future pension fund obligations.\n    It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate\nSpain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the\nCommunity last year.\n    Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a\nprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign\nbanks to open branches.\n    Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and\nthey now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets.\n    Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign\ncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a\nprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.\n    The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that\ndate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the\ncountry on new foreign currency loans.\n    The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion\npesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be\ngiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.\n    Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign\ncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by\nissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.\n    They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign\nissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.\n    Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,\ninstead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.\n    The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the\namount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited\nto three times a bank's capital equity.\n    The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most\nbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which\nimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta\nfunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.\n    The reserve requirement, which was already in place on\nnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign\nspeculative capital which is entering the country and\nthreatening the government's money supply growth target.\n    A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now\naccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a\ndisadvantage with European competitors.\n    The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements\nto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of\ninterest rate deregulation. \"The real problem is the freeing of\ninterest rates,\" the banker said. \"This is going to take a big\nbite out of profits.\"\n    The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid\non deposits of up to 180 days.\n    The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the\nmeasure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this\nyear.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Clearing and\ndelivery is through the facilities of the Dutch central bank.\n    Amsterdam is the third Dutch municipality to use a\ncommercial paper program as credit facility. The Hague and\nRotterdam preceded with programs arranged by Algemene Bank\nNederland NV <ABNN.AS>. Details of the first tranche of the\nprogram are still unknown.\n    \"At the moment, commercial paper is a cheaper form of credit\nthan the traditional \"kasgeldleningen',\" said Amsterdam's\nfinancial alderman Walter Etty after signing the contract.\nCurrent regulations allowed the city to acquire only half of\nits short term borrowing requirement with CPs, he added.\n    Kasgeldleningen or short term advances are a widely used\ninstrument in the Dutch market which has faced competition from\nCPs since the Finance Ministry approved them in January 1986.\n    \"CPs and CDs are currently slightly cheaper than traditional\ncredit lines for promotional reasons,\" Amro board member Dick\nMeys told journalists at the signing ceremony.\n    Despite the lower cost to borrowers, the Dutch market for\ncommercial paper and certificates of deposits is growing only\nslowly in the face of the well-developed kasgeld market and\ninstitutional investors have hardly discovered this instrument,\nMeys said.\n    Foreign interest in guilder CPs and CDs is almost\nnon-existent due to the strong position of the guilder, but\nAmro's London-based subsidiary EBC Amro Bank Ltd joined the\nsyndicate in case such interest emerges, Meys said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The chairmen of the House and Senate\nBudget Committees are in general accord on the need to cut the\nfederal budget deficit by about 36 billion dlrs, half through\nnew revenues, congressional sources said.\n    The sources told Reuters Senate Budget Committee Chairman\nLawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, believes that it would be\nnecessary to raise \"at least\" 18 billion dlrs in higher\nrevenues--the same being proposed by House Budget Committee\nChairman William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat.\n    The Senate committee will hold its first drafting session\non a budget tomorrow, the House group later in the week.\n    Both sides want to meet a congressional target of April 15\nfor congressional approval of a new budget. However, the\nCongressional Budget Office said that a deficit cut of 36\nbillion dlrs will fail to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law\ngoal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billion\ndlrs short. \n    President Reagan's budget, not accepted by either\ncommittee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficit\nreductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenues\nthrough asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimated\ndeficit base of 144 billion dlrs.\n    Reagan said his budget hits the Gramm-Rudman goal for 1988\nbut the Congressional Budget Office said it is way off the mark\nwith over optimistic economic assumptions.\n    Currently, there are discussions underway by House and\nSenate committees to redefine the fixed Gramm-Rudman targets\nfor more realistic levels that can be reached, which would push\noff by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget,\nsources said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Otherwise a\nmajor chance for West Germany as a financial centre will have\nbeen missed,\" he said.\n    After the January 25 election the government decided upon a\nreform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cuts\nof 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.\n    In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetary\nconference in Paris, the government said earlier this month\npart of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.\n    Government sources have said the fact the latest coalition\ndiscussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does not\nnecessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolished\nlater in the current four-year legislative period.\n    The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades where\nan end-investor is involved, generated government revenue of\nsome 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.\n    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons for\nmaintaining the tax because companies would benefit from its\nabolition. Their earnings would increase and the government\nwould receive more in profits tax.\n    Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said\nthe bourse tax decision did not fit into the general background\nof liberalisation of the German capital market, and represented\na weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In this\ncontext, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase\nthe scope of tax cuts due in 1988.\n    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled\nfor 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this\nmonth, was an \"important step in the right direction.\"\n    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from\n56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut\nthe maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was\n\"rather half-hearted.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It is the international financial community\nthat is taking away resources from the developing countries.\"\n    \"The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the\nthird biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had\nremitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only\ntwo billion in fresh funds,\" he added.\n    Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe\nand Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend\ninterest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he\nstressed the country's commitment to growth.\n    \"We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt\nproblem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop\ngrowing,\" he said, adding that political and not purely\ncommercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.\n    Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest\nin the developing world, has been under pressure from official\nand private creditors to work out an economic adjustment\nprogram with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign\npayments problems.\n    President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused\nto approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead\nto recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he\nhad tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of\nfinding a lasting solution to the debt problem.\n    \"We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be\none of continuous crisis.\"\n    To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more\nmachinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw\nmaterials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this\nyear's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5\nbillion.\n    Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction\nin the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic\nproduct in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should\nfall to 1.5 pct this year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A 0/92 program would have very\nlittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only\nan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according\nto a report from the Agriculture Department.\n    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres\nidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35\nmln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln\ndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.\n    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92\nacreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.\nLast year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.\n    \"The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very\nlarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quite\nsmall,\" the report said.\n    \"The returns on typical farms still favor participation in\nthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted\nacreage,\" the USDA report said.\n    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego\nplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,\nwould be most used by producers in high production/high risk\nareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,\ndirector of USDA's economics analysis staff.\n    \"In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much\nparticipation,\" Collins said.\n    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat\nwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000\nacres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.\n    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40\nmln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels\nof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of\ncotton, the report said.\n    \"In determining whether to participate, a producer would\nneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the\nloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the\nexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be\nconsidered,\" according to the analysis.\n    \"What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between\nthe loan rate and the cost of production,\" Collins said.\n    For producers with low production costs, that difference is\ngreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.\nUnder these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along\nwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more\nattractive.\n    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be\nmore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.\n    \"I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at\nfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separating\nproduction decisions from government payments,\" Collins said.\n    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and\nFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too\nlate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will\nbe over by the end of this month.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Finance Corporation\nis planning to intervene to help certain developing country\ncompanies to borrow on world capital markets, IFC chief\nexecutive Sir William Ryrie told a news conference.\n    Ryrie said the IFC is at present seeking to overcome\nregulatory barriers to its underwriting business on the United\nStates and London markets.\n    \"There are many companies in the more advanced developing\ncountries which are strong enough to borrow by issuing bonds or\nfloating rate notes,\" he added.\n    However, such companies needed help and the IFC could play\na role by introducing them into the market and underwriting\nissues, Ryrie said.\n    \"The capital markets would then get used to the idea of\nbuying the paper of these companies,\" he added. \"There is a\npotential source of development finance there which could be\nvery large.\"\n    He said he was confident there were enough institutional\ninvestors who would be interested in taking paper in the\ninterests of portfolio diversification.\n    The IFC, whose role is to provide international financing\nfor private sector investments in developing nations, generally\ndoes this by providing pump priming finance to persuade western\ncompanies to invest in third world enterprises.\n    However, in recent years it has set up three investment\nfunds through which institutional investors can hold shares in\ndeveloping country stock exchanges.\n    It announced the third such fund, one of 30 mln dlrs for\ninvestment on the Thai stock exchange, in December. There is a\n120 mln dlr South Korea fund and one of 50 mln dlrs which\ninvests in a number of developing country stock exchanges.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Private coffee exporters say Colombia's\nmore pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the\ncountry does not suffer excessively from current depressed\nprices and erratic market conditions.\n    Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association,\nsaid in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest\nproducer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of\nInternational Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas.\n    \"Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most\nfrom this situation,\" he said.\n    Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over\nre-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986,\nand no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.\n    Arango said that government measures adopted here last\nweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated a\nmajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.\n    \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world\nmarket conditions are also new,\" he said.\n    The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said\nthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed\nmore often in order to closely reflect market trends.\n    Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was\nthe decision on Friday to open export registrations for an\nunlimited amount.\n    But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy\nselling of coffee.\n    \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but\nconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react\nto market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of\ngiving its coffee away.\"\n    Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming\nexports, he said.\n    \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but\nneither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full\nwell what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said.\n    Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,\nexported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year\nwhich ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.\n    Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions\nbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not\nexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the\nNational Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\"\n    He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the\nnumber one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was\nlikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and\noscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.\n    On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said\nColombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed\nto force a compromise.\n    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head\nof his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the\nintransigence of some big countries, without naming them.\n    However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar\nGaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States\nwould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming\nweeks to revise its policy.\n    \"Washington will have to take into account that for many\ncountries, and some of its allies for instance in Central\nAmerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have\nfar-reaching political and economic consequences.\"\n    Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export\nquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which\ncould emerge from continuous contacts.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried\nMartens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987\ngovernment financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.\n    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to\n419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of\n417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.\n    Martens said following a lowering of government estimates\nof 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government\ndepartments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that\nunless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the\ntarget by 22.5 billion francs.\n    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts\nby 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.\nThe remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through\ntreasury operations.\n    Martens said the money is being found through a series of\nsmall economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of\ntwo billion francs through the sale of part of the government's\n50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.\n    Last year, the government announced a major program\ndesigned to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.\n    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the\ngovernment said was a \"snowball effect\" under which the\ngovernment constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits\nwhich were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying\nexisting debt.\n    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated\nat 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "<Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique\namong Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global\nexpansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its\nyearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.\n    First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst\nMichael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is\nattainable. But it \"will be a tremendous achievement because\n... they're going to have to build an international earnings\nbase larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic\ntrust companies,\" Walsh said.\n    Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's\n154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth\nthis year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company\nprofit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.\n    He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26\npct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.\n    Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with\nassets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated\ninternationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.\n    Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when\nother Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and\nloans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.\n    The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened\ndomestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank\noperations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,\nCornelissen said.\n    Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and\nAsia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical\nCo <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset\nmanagement, merchant and private banking companies.\n    \"It was a heaven-sent opportunity,\" Cornelissen said of the\nDow Financial acquisition. \"We achieved in one year what would\notherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.\"\n    Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct\ncompetition with major global financial institutions in\nactivities such as international lending and stock brokerage,\nin order to exploit \"profitable niches\" overseas in traditional\ntrust activities such as asset management, private banking and\nadvisory services.\n    He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations\n\"before the end of this month\" to sell its London-based Savory\nMilln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.\n    \"The international market is so big and we have such a\nminiscule share of it that growth opportunities are really\nlimited only by our energy and our desire to find more\nbusiness,\" he said, adding that in trust-type services, \"we\ndon't think the international markets are well-served.\"\n    Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign \ninvestment interest in North America and increased Canadian\ninvestment abroad, Cornelissen said.\n    Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid\neconomic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said\nCornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion\ndlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.\n    Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia\nwill contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of\nglobal productive capacity, Cornelissen said, \"We knew we had\nto be there.\" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include\noffices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also\nrecently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n    The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing\ngrowth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any\nacquisitions in the \"immediate future,\" although \"we have our\neyes wide open for the right opportunities.\"\n    Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the\ncompany abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,\nCornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well\ncovered by hundreds of small regional banks.\n    \"That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,\"\nsaid Cornelissen. \"That is probably one area that we will\nprobably do something with in the next five years.\"\n    He said the company would continue to emphasize its home\nCanadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services\nanalysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.\n    Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,\ntrusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in\none another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition\nfor Royal Trust, \"but not drastically more,\" Cornelissen said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The outlook for 1987 remains at\n2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.\n    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.\n    \"Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,\nwe believe that profits could begin to improve in the second\nhalf - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through\n1988 and 1989,\" he said.\n    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors\n- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and\nimproved demand.\n    The higher prices will stick because its Japanese\ncompetitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the\nincreased value of the yen, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Consul Restaurant Corp said it began\nan exchange offer for its 13 pct convertible debentures due\n1992 with an aggregate principal amount of 17.5 mln dlrs.\n    Consul officials told an analysts meeting that in return\nfor each 1,000 dlr face value of the bonds tendered, investors\nwill receive 10 shares of preferred stock convertible after Dec\n1, 1987, into 500 shares of common. The company said the value\nrepresents a substantial premium over the debentures' market\nvalue, which traded at 410 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face amount on\nMarch 13.\n    Consul said the debt was taken on to finance expansion.\n    James Crivits, Consul chairman, said debt service on the\noutstanding debentures has cost the company 55 cts a share per\nquarter and cut deeply into the company's profitability.\n    For the year ended May 31, 1986, the company reported a net\nloss of 1.12 dlr per share or 5.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 77.6\nmln dlrs.\n    Crivits said the company will report an improved but still\nunprofitable third quarter ended February 28, compared to a\nloss of 22 cts a share in the year-ago thrid quarter. He said\ncurrent third quarter results would be similar to 1987's\nsecond quarter's loss of 12 cts per share.\n    Crivits said the company will not produce a gain in the\nfourth quarter or the full year, and said there will be a write\noff in the fourth quarter for the debenture exchange offer. He\nwould not specify the amount of the write off.\n    Robert Lamp, Consul's chief financial officer, said the\ncompany needs to have at least 90 pct of the bonds exchanged in\nthe transaction to report a profit in the first quarter of\nfiscal 1988. Lamp said that if the exchange is successful, the\ncompany will report profits much higher than the three cents a\nshare reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1987.\n    The Minneapolis-based company, which it said is the\nnation's largest franchisee of Chi-Chi's family-style Mexican\nrestaurants, said it had the planned to expand to 80 units, but\nhad to abandon the effort, leaving 38 units in operation.\n    The company also said the restaurants are profitable, with\nprofit margins increasing over last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The federal Food and Drug\nAdministration's Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted\nunanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe and\neffective.\n    The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine for\nmarketing in the United States, so long as accompanying\npackaging and promotional materials disclose that the product\nhas only limited effect on male pattern baldness.\n    The five outside experts attending today's FDA committee\nmeeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after an\noutside consultant told them the drug \"appears to be quite safe\nin the normal male population.\"\n    The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of Medicine\nCarl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based on\na study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug in\nCanada, where it was approved for marketing last year.\n    \"The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of side\neffects,\" Leier said.\n    The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in the\ndrug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effects\nwhile taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changes\nin heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.\n    Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already been\napproved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressure\ndrug.\n    But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a male\nbaldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquid\nform.\n    Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to the\nscalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstream\nto affect the heart.\n    But panel members concluded that the amount absorbed\nmerited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.\n    Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official Richard\nDe Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials produced\nmoderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40\npct after 12 months.\n    He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make the\nnew hair fall out.\n    \"The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placebo\neffect,\" panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University of\nTexas told the meeting.\n    He said patients administered a placebo during clinical\ntrials typically had about half as much new hair growth as did\nindividuals treated with Rogaine.\n    As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months before\nthey can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, he\nsaid.\n    In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs\n(U.S.).\n    An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drug\nin the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.\n    During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre side\neffect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexual\ndysfunction known as \"exagerrated erection.\"\n    Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted a\nsafety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, said\nresearchers had found a number of cases of patients who had\nexagerrated erections as a result of the drug.\n    He said this was a common effect for drugs of the same\nclass as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.\n    FDA officials said they could make no prediction on when\nRogaine might be approved for marketing.\n    Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Boston\ndermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated the\neffect of the drug.\n    He said \"about one in five will have a substantial clinical\neffect,\" which he defined as a significant growth of new hair\nthat made the patient actually look better.\n    He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost of\nRogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fund\nresources.\n    \"I would hope that insurance companies will take a strong\nline that this is not a product we will reimburse for,\" Stern\ntold reporters.\n    \"I think this is a drug that has some application for some\npeople, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,\"\nhe said.\n    But he said individuals should be required to pay for the\ntreatment out of their personal funds.\n    Stern estimated more than 100,000 American men are already\nusing minoxidil on their scalps, outside the law, by grinding\nup the blood pressure pill and dissolving in a solvent.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Toronto Sun publishes tabloids in Toronto,\nEdmonton and Calgary, Alberta and the Houston Post.\n    Asked about possible financial or editorial support by\nToronto Sun, Jackson replied: \"It is far too premature to\ndiscuss anything like that.\" He said further developments were\nunlikely to unfold for \"at least a month.\"\n    Jackson described the British tabloid market as \"very\ncompetitive, but it is a very large market as well. It most\nlikely doesn't take a large market share to be profitable there\nas long as you find the right niche.\"\n    He said Toronto Sun is approached almost every month about\nideas for starting newspapers, mostly in North America, \"as the\nToronto Sun is known to be a newspaper group that has started\npapers.\n    \"Unfortunately, this one leaked out and it probably\nattracted a little more attention than it really deserves at\nthis point,\" Jackson said.\n    Toronto Sun recently dropped plans to start a second\nEnglish language newspaper in Montreal, citing a study that\nindicated the lack of a sufficient advertising base for such a\npaper.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They must be given the opportunity to trade their way\nto prosperity.\"\n    Few detials have been released on the trade talks which\nwere launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that\nare each others most important trading partners.\n    Recent published reports in Canada, quoting senior trade\nsources, said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal\nand it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many\nnon-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is\na Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes,\nsomething that would give Canada protection from Washington's\ntough trade remedy laws.\n    But Mulroney, sharply critical of protectionist sentiment\nin the U.S, said Canada was a \"fair trader\" and denied the\ngovernment was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the\nAmerican market.\n    He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides.\n    \"We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal, one that is\nfair to both sides,\" Mulroney said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Since then,\nthe trend has been down.\n    Last September's share offer, which triggered criticism by\nunderwriters about the handling of the sale, opened at a\nsubstantial discount to its offer price, resulting in losses\nfor holders of the shares.\n    Some analysts have said the size of offer was too big for\nthe market to handle efficiently.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The market in floating rate notes showed\nno clear signs of recovery today from the confusion which sent\nprices tumbling and paralysed trading at the end of last week,\ndealers and bank officials said.\n    FRN dealers said at least 10 houses did not open for\nbusiness with many market operators pausing to assess their\nnext steps in the wake of Friday's huge drops and panic\ntrading.\n    Despite some late signs that prices were recovering last\nweek, today's erratic trade provided a similarly mixed final\npicture with longer-dated FRNs still clearly under pressure.\n    While FRN specialists noted that paper on which coupons are\nshortly due to be refixed had managed to hold up today, as had\nnotes paying a relatively higher margin, longer term FRNs were\nstill subject to intense selling pressure.\n    \"Anything longer than 10 years is still being sold off\nseriously, as is just about any paper in the banking sector,\"\none FRN market source at a leading U.S. House said.\n    He noted that one long-dated Citicorp issue -- paper which\nhas suffered recently on fears over Latin American debt\nexposure -- slipped by two points to around 94.00. FRNs, whose\ncoupons are refixed regularly, usually trade around par.\n    U.S. And Canadian bank paper was still generally under\npressure, as was Republic of Ireland paper, due to renewed\nworries about the Irish economic situation.\n    The malaise was felt through the banking sector with a two\npoint fall registered by one BNP note, to give a three point\ndrop over two trading days.\n    Retail clients, usually seen returning to the market as\nprice falls push yield margins up to these attractive levels,\nhave been unnerved by the last three days' panic, dealers said.\n    \"Yes, there's been some bargain hunting, but no one dares to\nbe first to come seriously back in,\" said one dealer.\n    \"A handful of market giants have frightened the retail away\nwith this aggressive manipulation. As true liquidity drains, we\nare going to have to see some better market cooperation and\nrationalisation,\" commented one FRN trader now dealing with\nstraight bond issues since the floater market crisis.\n    This view was shared by the majority of FRN market sources\npolled by Reuters since trade began to collapse last week.\n    Of the 50 or so houses who have up until now made a market\nin floaters, dealers estimated that around a dozen did not\nquote FRN prices today and they reported that one or two houses\nwere not expected to resume trade in the securities at all.\n    Many called meetings to assess the current market\nsituation.\n    \"Given the potential volatility of this market -- one which\nhas been conclusively proved by the events of the last days --\nsenior management are now duty bound to revise the set of\nparameters within which they, as market makers, are now to\nwork,\" commented one senior source at a leading U.K. Investment\nhouse.\n    However, there were no reports that a formal crisis meeting\nof market makers -- such as that called in December last year\nduring the perpetual FRN market collapse -- was on the cards.\n    Several firms were expected to cut back drastically on the\nlist of FRNs traded, with most volatile paper first to go.\n    Elsewhere in the eurobond market, business was extremely\nquiet, with virtually no activity seen in the dollar straight\nsector which has been becalmed of late, traders said.\n    \"There has been no real two-way business today, neither has\nthere been any new issues for diversion,\" noted one trader.\n    \"All we have seen today is some squaring up of positions,\"\nshe added. Investors remain cautious of the dollar, which\nthough recently stable, still has potential downside risk.\n    Eurosterling, the market sector which, aside from the FRNs,\nhas been in the headlines lately, was quiet today ahead of the\nU.K. Government budget due to be announced tomorrow.\n    Undertone was very firm with dealers expecting a positive\nfiscal package tomorrow and, if not more good economic news to\nboost sterling, at least confirmation of the bull factors which\nhave bolstered eurosterling and gilt-edged bonds lately.\n    \"It was just sit and wait today but I expect it will be full\nsteam ahead on Wednesday,\" commented one sterling market source.\n    Prices showed gains to 1/8 to 3/8 point across the board.\n    Dealers said several new eurosterling issues were currently\nin the pipeline and an early issue is expected to be for a\nmajor European bank which currently has a mandate in the\nmarket.\n    In other sectors, euroyen also maintained its firm tone.\n    Although the market is expected to be resting until trading\nswitches to an April value date, the euroyen sector is expected\nto be buoyed by some professional switching out of Japanese\ngovernment bonds into relatively cheaper euroyen bonds.\n    Two new yen issues were features on an otherwise quiet\nprimary market. Both for 15 billion yen due 1992, the first for\nEksportfinans was at five pct and 103 pct, led by Mitsubishi\nFinance International. The second for Export Development Corp\nat 4-1/2 pct and 101-7/8 pct led by Bank of Tokyo\nInternational.\n    The day's only other feature was a targetted 30 mln dlr\nstepped coupon deal for Kawasaki Steel due 1994.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A group controlled by Equitable\nBancorp Chairman Alfred Lerner said it has acquired a 9.6 pct\nstake in AmeriTrust Corp <AMTR> and may buy up to 24.9 pct if\nobtains regulatory approval.\n    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nthe group said it bought its stake of 2.0 mln Ameritrust common\nshares, for 81.1 mln dlrs as an investment.\n    But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Cleveland\npartnership, also said it would seek regulatory approval to\nincrease its stake. Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is the\ngeneral partner of Clevebaco L.P.\n    The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve\nBoard on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pct\nof the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holding\ncompany.\n    If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is\nalso in Cleveland, said he intends to buy more AmeriTrust\nstock, subject to market conditions and other factors.\n    Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets\ngreater than one billion dlrs, he said he is barred by law from\nserving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having his\nrepresentatives on its board.\n    Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrust\nmanagement or its policies.\n    The group said Clevebaco L.P. bought one mln of its shares\nfrom Bear, Stearns and Co Inc on March 9 at 41 dlrs a share.\n    Lerner said he accumulated the other one mln shares through\nMarch 3 and sold them to Clevebaco L.P., which he controls, on\nMarch 10 for 40.10 dlrs a share.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Hughes\neconomist Ike Kerridge said the U.S. rig count was expected to\nfall to a about 700 working rigs by mid-April.\n    \"I think we're pretty much on track with the expectation\nthat the seasonal low will come in late March or early April,\"\nhe said. \"We're getting close to the bottom.\"\n   Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported gains\nin drilling activity last week, with increases of 21 and 13,\nrespectively. Kerridge attributed the jump in activity to the\nlikelihood that many of the rigs were omitted from the previous\nweek's count because they were in transit or being prepared for\nwork. In the week ended March 9, the rig count for Texas and\nOklahoma fell by 23 and 13, respectively.\n    Other states reported slight decreases in drilling activity\nlast week, Hughes said. Wyoming and Louisiana were down by six,\nKansas and Colorado lost four and Michigan and West Virginia\nwere down by three rigs.\n    Most of the week's decrease came among rigs used for\nonshore drilling, which dropped to a total of 669 from last\nweek's 671. A total of 74 rigs were active offshore and 1 were\nworking in inland waters during the week, Hughes Tool said.\n    In Canada, the rig count was up 1 to 181, against 367 one\nyear ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Norway's parliament has approved an\nextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a\nkey loophole through which controversial oil shipments on\nNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.\n    The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority\nLabour government, gives domestic companies until late\nSeptember to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and\nNamibia.\n    \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an\nisolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\"\nNorway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.\n    Government officials said they hope the move will intensify\ninternational pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid\npolicies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt\nall trade with South Africa by October.\n    Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments\nto South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important\nexception for ships whose final destination is decided while\nthey are at sea.\n    Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,\nmaking it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final\nport at the start of a voyage.\n    Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued\noil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter\nsanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.\n    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct\nof its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has\ndropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,\ntrade ministry officials said.\n    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South\nAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight\nmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns\nfrom the year-ago figure.\n    \"Many would say that the law has already had its effect\nbecause of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and\nNorway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.\n    \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring\nits relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.\n    \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on\ninternational trade with South Africa, but it is an important\npolitical statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said.\n    The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the\nban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose\namendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.\n    Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to\nhigh-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it\nferro-alloys and light metals industries.\n    Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be\naffected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores\nare not found.\n    The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal\nratification later this week, parliamentarians said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's\ndefines the AA category as only slightly different from the top\nAAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement.\n    \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing\ncapability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against\nexpectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account\ndeficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and\ncapability,\" he added.\n    \"Standard & Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series\nof austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and\nencourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.\n    \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be\nready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives\nas it has in the past,\" Simonsen said.\n   Standard and Poor's said weaker international\ncompetitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a\ndeteriorating current account balance and a rise in external\ndebt.\n    The external current account deficit rose to a record\npreliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in\n1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,\naccording to government statistics.\n    Government economists forecast that the external current\naccount deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.\n    Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports\nin 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a\nshowdown between protectionists and free traders as a major\ntrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the\nfull House of Representatives in late April.\n    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key\nHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of\nlegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against\nforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.\n    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts\nto restore competitiveness of American industries and turn\naround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.\n    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement\nof trade laws.\n    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on\ncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products\nin the United States at prices below cost of production. It\nalso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry\ncomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too\nmany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back\namendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade\nagreements or keep out U.S. products.\n    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade\nsaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes\nand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.\n    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not\none \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\"\nbut he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work\ntoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.\n    The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy\nstronger without violating our international trade agreements,\"\nhe said.\n    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means\nCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if\nit would hurt the U.S. economy.\n    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was\nnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign\ninto law.\n    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough\nHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he\nonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw\nDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.\n    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late\nlast week that the administration still did not like some of\nthe bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very\ngood about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\n    The first battle will take place next week when the full\nHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\nRichard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South\nKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.\n    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\nthat the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\nStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\nbut would not automatically set off retaliation.\n    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from\nimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.\n    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the\nadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign\nwould not be worth passage in Congress.\n    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by\nsaying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane\nKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed\nby the president.\"\n    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill\nto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide\nsaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.\n    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most\ninfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by\nlow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for\nimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his\nsupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import\ntariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Africa may have to follow Brazil in\nhalting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are\nprepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy,\nEthiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.\n    Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had\ncaused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all\ndeveloping countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting\nof African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.\n    Unless there was an early improvement in developing\ncountries' terms of trade \"the only choice is to follow the\nroute that Brazil appears to have taken,\" Tesfay said.\n   The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was\ncalled to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77\nministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing\ncountries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations\nwith the West.\n    Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation\nof recent commodity agreements.\n    The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to\nagree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean \"several\nAfrican countries will not have the foreign exchange to import\nessential items,\" he said.\n    Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the\nrecent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N.\nEconomic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was\nan increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.\n    He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and\nthe repatriation of profits by foreign investors.\n    Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign\ndebt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected\nto rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.\n    He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide\nmore resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's\neconomic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness\nto raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.\n    The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion\ndlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.\n    Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs,\nwith the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji\nsaid the donors had not responded as hoped.\n   In view of this poor response, he said \"it is possible that\nby the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few,\nwill be categorised as least developed countries.\"\n    At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officially\nlisted in this category.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "New Nebraska Republican Senator\nDavid Karnes said he supports proposals to \"decouple\" farm\nsubsidies from production decisions.\n    Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. in\nOmaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the late\nSen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).\n    On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradual\nreductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should be\ncontinued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts in\ntarget prices each year are \"excessive.\"\n    Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls for\nmajor crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supported\nmandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm bill\nprovision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.\n    Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) to\nthe National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention\nearlier today and spoke to Reuters after Boschwitz addressed\nthe NGFA meeting.\n    Karnes said he is seeking a seat on the Senate Agriculture\nCommittee but no decision has been made on the request.\n    Karnes, who has not held political office before, was\nappointed by Nebraska Republican Governor Kay Orr. He will be\nup for election in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulations\nthat have control its long-distance phone business.\n    ATT spun off its local telephone services operations into\nthe seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  court\nordered breakup of the telephone giant.\n    The regional companies have been prohibited from\nmanufacturing equipment and from offering information services\nand out-of-region long-distance service.\n    But some of them want to move into those areas,\nparticularly the provision of long-distance services, which\nwould compete directly with ATT.\n    ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued in\nJanuary that proposed to streamline regulation of certain parts\nof its long-distance business.\n    The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of the\nproposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.\n    \"That would be foremost in our mind,\" Hess said.\n    Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.\n    Congressional aides said they were concerned that if\nregulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant market\nposition to raise consumer rates.\n    Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,\nits most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, without\nfull regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will be\npassed onto the consumer rather than big business.\n    ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.\n    The company would become more competitive because it would\nnot have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing new\nservices, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.\n    However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of\nAmerica, which represents more than 200 consumer groups\nnationally, said, \"When ATT offers new services, they tend to be\ngeared toward the high volume business market rather than the\naverage consumer.\"\n    ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,\nthe FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of\nthe current 45 days.\n    The company also called for a reduction in the amount of\ndocumentation it must file with the FCC each time it introduces\nor changes long-distance services.\n    \"With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace\na blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,\ntargeted approach,\" said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T's vice\npresident of marketing services, in a statement.\n    \"We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,\nthe public interest can be protected and all consumers will\nbenefit,\" he added.\n    MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to ease\nrestrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.\n    Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effort\nto halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and its\nrivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry. MCI lost\n448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.\n    The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI because\nATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have to\nfollow when costs fell in the industry.\n    \"I'm sort of mystified by those comments,\" retorted Herman, a\ndistrict manager for ATT.\n    \"ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing on\ncost reductions,\" she added.\n    Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,\nsaid he opposed deregulation because it left no alternatives\nthat would ensure against overcharging by ATT.\n    He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduce\nprices when the company was benefitting from lower costs from\nincreased use by consumers of long-distance services.\n    Without full regulatory authority this may no longer\nhappen, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He gave no other\ndetails.\n    Kan'an said the loans were for Jordan's own nine billion\ndlr 1986-1990 development plan and not for the parallel,\ncontroversial 1.3 billion dlr plan for the Israeli-occupied\nWest Bank and the Gaza strip.\n    He said jordan would concentrate on obtaining concessionary\nforeign loans and keep commercial borrowings to a minimum.\n    Performance in the first year of the national plan was\nclose to target, the Minister said. The gross domestic product\nat factor cost grew 2.4 per cent instead of the planned 2.9 per\ncent, he added, but gave no figures.\n    Kan'an said public investment was also near the planned\nlevel, but investments by the private sector fell below\nexpectations. \"The private sector still feels inhibited,\" he\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Seemala argued the move would be necessary if\nnoteholders of Ivan Boesky and Co L.P. are to be repaid.\n    In asking the SEC to speed its withdrawal as a registered\nbroker, Seemala said it wold repay to Boesky and Co, which is\nalso controlled by the former Wall Street arbitrageur, 660 mln\ndlrs in subordinated debt, plus accrued interest.\n    IFB Managing Partners, which was also given approval to\nwithdraw as a broker, has no significant assets, the SEC said.\n    Once it is repaid, Boesky and Co will pay 200 mln dlrs in\nsenior participating notes and 440 mln dlrs in subordinated\nparticipating notes of Hudson Funding Corp to certain\nnoteholders, Seemala told the SEC.\n    Under the planned repayment scheme, Seemala told the SEC\nthe noteholders would forgo claims of prepayment penalties and\nsome additional interest amounting to more than 100 mln dlrs.\n    The plan would be in the public interest, Seemala argued,\nsince the noteholders, many of which are savings and loan\ninstitutions and insurance companies, would receive repayment\nof the principal on their notes.\n    Seemala also argued that the plan would help the limited\npartners of Boesky and Co, who were not charged in the Boesky\ninsider trading scandal, by protecting its remaining equity\nfrom the noteholders' claims.\n    Unless the Boesky firms are allowed to complete the\nrepayment plan, Seemala said Boesky and Co noteholders would\nseek total claims of 116.8 mln dlrs, plus 9.2 mln dlrs to 10.6\nmln dlrs a month in addition, in addition to other claims.\n    Such claims could wipe out Boesky and Co's assets before\nother creditors can establish their claims, Seemala said.\n    The only opposition to Seemala's Feb 12 request to withdraw\nas a broker came from Berger and Montague P.C., counsel for the\nplaintiffs in a class action suit against Seemala and other\ndefendants. The suit involves charges stemming from Boesky's\ninsider trading in the stock of several major companies.\n    Berger and Montague told the SEC it opposes the Seemala\nproposal because it would allow Boesky and Co noteholders to\nsettle their claims ahead of the plaintiffs in the class action\nand because Seemala did not disclose the total amount of claims\nagainst it and what percentage defrauded investors would get.\n    Seemala has said that its repayment scheme would leave a\npool of about 278 mln dlrs free of claims from Boesky and Co\nnoteholders which could satisfy other claimants.\n    The pool would be in addition to funds placed in escrow\nunder insider trading settlement agreements, including 11.4 mln\ndlrs from Dennis Levine and 50 mln dlrs from Boesky.\n    In approving the request, the SEC barred Seemala and Boesky\nand Co from making any distributions to its limited partners\nfor one year and required limited partners who receive\ndistributions to agree to make themselves liabile up to a point\nin any case filed the partnerships.\n    The SEC also required Seemala and Boesky and Co to get\nconfirmation of their assets from a nationally recognized\naccounting firm.\n    The agency said Boesky and Co and existing and potential\nclaimants against it have similar interests in eliminating\nmajor creditors and preserving assets for future claims.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But he also said businessmen needed more finance and\nwelcomed measures being taken to encourage banks to step up\nlending.\n    A committee at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the\nkingdom's central bank, is now examining the problem.\n    Commercial banks are in fact extremely liquid but have\nbecome highly selective in extending new credit after many\ncompanies ran into trouble repaying debt during the last three\nyears.\n    Between 1982 and 1985 banks had to make risk provisions\ntotalling 4.3 billion riyals and results now coming in for 1986\nshow another year when heavy reserves had to be made against\nbad and doubtful loans.\n    The effects of the Middle East economic downturn hit the\nconstruction sector in Saudi Arabia very hard and there has\nbeen a sharp fall in development lending for new industrial\nprojects.\n    The Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source for\nprivate sector finance, made loan commitments totalling 752 mln\nriyals in the financial year to September 4, 1986, a decline of\nnearly 20 pct on the previous year.\n    The government credit agency specialises in low cost loans\nfor development, funding 50 pct of a project's total value.\n    The pattern of the agency's lending has also shown a\ndistinct shift away from infrastructre-related industry - such\nas cement plants - to capital-intensive projects.\n    Businessmen said opportunities are now available in service\nindustries and tourism which is slowly developing in the Gulf\nregion. But new investment in manufacturing industry shows\nfewer signs of taking hold.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. money managers and investment\nadvisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperform\nbonds, but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half of\nportfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts.\n    Merrill Lynch said its new asset mix report due today will\nurge weightings of 50 pct stock, 35 pct bonds and 15 pct cash\nversus 40 pct bonds, 35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously.\n    \"We believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted because\nof the positive momentum of corporate earnings,\" said Christine\nLisec-Tinto, Merrill senior investment strategist.\n    Lisec-Tinto, who formulated Merrill's latest asset mix\nrecommendations with new chief investment strategist Charles\nClough, said there may be some consolidation of recent stock\nprice gains, but the market appears to have good potential.\n    Through Friday, stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average surged 19.13 pct in 1987. Meanwhile, the \nShearson Lehman Treasury bond price index edged up 0.4 pct.\n    \"We believe that the equity market has much more upside\npotential than the bond market,\" Chrysler Corp <C> treasurer\nFred Zuckerman said. He said \"interest rates are not coming\ndown and I would not bet a lot that they will come down\nsharply.\"\n    Chrysler's 3.5 billion pension fund last week sold 405 mln\ndlrs of corporate bonds in the first of two planned sales of\nslightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates.\n    Zuckerman told Reuters the proceeds will be used to buy\nstock to bring equities to 50 pct or more of the portfolio.\n    A roughly even bond/stock portfolio split also is urged by\nWright Investors Service, with 4.25 billion dlrs under\nmanagement, but it is more optimistic on bonds than stocks.\n    \"We'd put half in bonds and half in equities now,\" said\nJudith Corchard, Wright senior vice president. She said the\nbond share was lifted from 35 pct in the last three months.\n    \"The stock market has appreciated sharply and discounted\nfuture corporate earnings extensively,\" Corchard said. She said\n\"we're worried about a stock price correction of as much as 10\nto 15 pct within six, or possibly even three months.\"\n    Meanwhile, Wright expects bonds to benefit from a half to\none percentage point decline in interest rates by year's end.\n    \"At this level of the stock market, there is more of an\nadvantage to being in long-term bonds than in equities, given\nour interest rate scenario,\" Corchard said.\n    \"The stock market has come a long way in a short time. I'd\nbe hardpressed to jump into stocks with the Dow near 2300\nunless I was really convinced that earnings and multiples will\nincrease,\" said a fixed-income securities portfolio manager at\na major money center bank.\n    He said the bank has kept bond/equity portfolio mix fairly\nstable recently and probably will make no major changes for\nmonths as it awaits economic, oil price and dollar trends.\n    \"We've seen no real movement from bonds to stocks among our\nfunds,\" said George Collins, president of T. Rowe Price\nAssociates, with 22 billion dlrs in assets under management.\n    While he detected no rush into stocks from bonds, either\namong the many mutual funds under the T. Rowe Price umbrella or\namong outside money managers, Collins thinks stocks are better\ninvestments than bonds at this time.\n    \"In the near term, the stock market has more prospects for\ngrowth, due to the mixed signals on the economy so far, the\nslim chance the Federal Reserve will ease policy and still\nheavy debt accumulation,\" Collins said.\n    He expects U.S. stocks to improve further because there is\nmore corporate earnings potential, nominal interest rates\nalready are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock.\n    Collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks,\nthe firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting in\nequity with the rest in bonds and cash.\n    \"Our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cash\nposition in equity portfolios lately,\" Collins said.\n    \"Cash\" in portfolios usually means short Treasury bills\nwhich can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts.\n    Many portfolio managers are working with relatively high\ncash positions in equity accounts, often 25 to 30 pct, given  \nthe belief that there may well be downward price corrections\nenroute to higher ground.\n    In bond portfolios, the money managers generally showed a\npreference for shorter term (10 years and under) Treasury notes\nand, to a lesser extent, agency securities, rather than\nlonger-dated Treasury issues and corporate bonds.\n    Since yield premiums of corporate over Treasury bonds are\nnow the lowest in years, many investors believe corporates are\novervalued versus Treasury and agency issues. Another negative\ncited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers,\nleveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does not\nexist with Treasury or Federal agency securities.\n    Farm Credit paper was cited by some as undervalued and a\ngood buy, despite the issuer's well-publicized financial woes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The company ended up\nrecording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth\nquarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.\n    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but\nindustry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about\n200 mln dlrs.\n    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.\nJustice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm\nBaldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations\nabout the transaction since it was announced.\n    Government officials have expressed concern that the sale\ncould reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting\nkey advanced technology into Japanese hands.\n    New, high-technology semiconductors are used in\nsupercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than\nexisting computers.\n    Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by\nFrench interests and headquartered in New York.

This would compare with a 1986 surplus of\n9.5 billion dlrs.\n    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs\nand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled\n22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.\n    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion\ndlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with\ngovernment plans to foster economic growth.\n    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above\nthe traditional average for Brazil.\n    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil\nand wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in\nthe same 1986 period.\n    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian\nindustry to equip to raise production and is perfectly\ncompatible with the government's program for economic growth,\nFendt added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Rothschild.\n    \"There are unquestionably other buyers out there,\" added\nKidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. \"A lot of companies have\nlooked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.\"\n    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for\nFairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,\nand LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,\nTexas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might also\nseek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust\nproblems, the analysts added.\n    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be\nconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,\nCalif., company, analysts said.\n    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the\nagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened\nup other possibilities, including a possible buyout by\nFairchild management.\n    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would\nhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,\nbecause rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan\nadministration made it unlikely that the sale could be\ncompleted within a reasonable period of time.\n    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that\nthe companies did not need government approval to complete the\ntransaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned\ncompanies.\n    \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because\nthe U.S. government didn't want it,\" said Johnson of L.F.\nRothschild.\n    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the\ncompany's news release.\n    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of\npossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.\n    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately\navailable for comment.\n    Analysts noted the significance of the government's\napparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of\nFairchild.\n    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,\nfeared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control\nof key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military\nweapons systems.\n    \"The government really stood up for the semiconductor\nindustry,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. \"That, I think, is\nthe real significance of this.\"\n    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might\nnow feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about\nJapanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade\nagreement signed last summer.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 9.5 billion\ndlrs.\n    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs\nand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled\n22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.\n    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion\ndlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with\ngovernment plans to foster economic growth.\n    Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the\ntraditional average for Brazil.\n    Imports in the first two months of the year, excluding oil\nand wheat, totalled 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in\nthe same 1986 period.\n    This rise reflected industry's need for equipment to raise\nproduction and is perfectly compatible with the government's\nprogram for economic growth, Fendt added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of\noffering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in\ncertificates.\n    The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with\n77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not\nhave to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.\n    This would have the effect of lowering the world price,\nmaintaining domestic support levels and reducing the\ngovernment's soybean inventory.\n    A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last\nweek's meeting, participants said.\n    One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting\nwas a \"listening session\" for USDA, and that the proposals will\nnow be studied further by the Department.\n    USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time\nframe. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in\nthe soybean loan to be announced in the near future.\n    \"USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could\ninfluence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,\"\na participant said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Corporate raider Carl Icahn\nacknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible\nviolations of securities laws.\n    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc\n<TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to\nmake with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.\n    The SEC issued a formal order launching the private\ninvestigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.\n    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out\nwhether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws\nand related rules, Icahn said.\n    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and\nsubsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain\nunspecified companies, he said.\n    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals\nwho have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in\ncompanies of at least five pct within 10 days.\n    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in\nconnection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has\ndisclosed that he is among those being investigated.\n    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is\nobviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also\nalerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.\n    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they\nor their officers are the targets of government probes to\nacknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret\ninvestigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements\nto their shareholders.\n    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others\nwhom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and\nselling more than five pct of a company's stock.\n    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities\nlaw violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe\ninto the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to\npublished reports.\n    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount\nof stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making\nno filing at all could indicate a scheme to \"warehouse\" shares\nof stock.\n    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in\nconcert would each amass stock in the company without\ndisclosing that they have an agreement among them.\n    By failing to disclose that they are acting together the\nmarket is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is\ncontrolled by a group acting in concert.\n    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg\nfamily of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while\nit was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is\npursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct\nannual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder\nof the decade.\n    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per\nshare on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.\n    The company said in its annual report that its\nnonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting\nits earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than\nits pharmaceutical business.\n    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication\nTagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings\nfrom existing products, expand its product portfolio and\noptimize its financial resources.\n    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which\nTagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy\nto develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered\nby two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pending\nventure in Japan.\n    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care\nproducts division can be a one billion dlr organization in the\nnext five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct\nannually.\n    \"Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility,\" Gavin\nHerbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said\nin the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln\ndlrs.\n    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories\npharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will\nfile for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a\nnumber of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen\nactivator, over the next two years.\n    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct\nlarger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.\n    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing\nunit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a\nyear, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in\ntesting for the AIDS antibody.\n    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the\ncost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three\nyears, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.\n    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,\nincluding its new chief operating officer George Ebright.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. Defense\nDepartment, in part on national security grounds.\n    Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the department\nhad had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal.\n    A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware\nof Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediate\nreaction.\n    Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had\njoined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have\nleft the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for\nvital equipment used in high-technology weapons.\n    Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed from\nongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan,\nofficials said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

After several years of large\nlosses, the railroad company turned its first profit in 1981.\n    Last year Conrail earned 431 mln dlrs on revenues of 3.14\nbillion dlrs, down slightly from its 1985 profit of 442 mln\ndlrs on revenues of 3.21 billion dlrs.\n    Conrail operated its last passenger service in 1982.\n    Legislation passed by Congress last year calling for the\npublic sale of Conrail set two billion dlrs as a target to be\nraised.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Banco Royal is the only\nCanadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of\nMontreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.\n    Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an\nequitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68\nbillion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is\nessentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a\nposition to resume debt repayments within a year.\n    Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's\ninterest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Latin America urgently needs more money\nif it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, but\nfresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to\nbe in short supply.\n    Bankers, officials and academics at a conference organized\nby the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed the\nimportance of proper economic policies and increased private\ninvestment. But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to\nbanish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's\n380 billion dlr debt. \"Such a solution is still not in sight,\"\nsaid Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.\n    The conference was held against the background of the\nrecent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,\nbut it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who\nspelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused\nby the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.\n    Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks\nfor a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will have\nto grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply\nto restore per capita income to the level of 1975.\n    He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come\npartly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone\nwill not be enough.\n    \"We have to reduce the transfer of resources,\" Brodersohn\nsaid, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America\nmake this a matter of urgency.\n    Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did not\nspell out how this should be achieved.\n    The creditors' strategy, spelled out by U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker in October 1985, is to spur additional\nlending by private banks and multilateral development banks in\nreturn for economic reforms.\n    But there was a widespread recognition at the conference\nthat the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.\n    Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actually\ndeclined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.\n    Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that\nwill be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, which\ncalled for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target\nthat Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said\nis now optimistic.\n    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American\nAffairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan \"has not\nyet succeeded as well as we hoped.\"\n    But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an\nofficial commitment to try a new tack, they must have been\ndisappoiunted.\n    Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviision\nat the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted in\nnot lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.\n    He said some streamlining of the lending process may be\nneeded, but added, \"I see no alterantive to the present course\nof responsible cooperation.\"\n    A major theme at the conference, however, was that the\nworld economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors\nand creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of\nrecession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America will\nbe even more hard-pressed to service its debts.\n    Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan\nGuaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that world\neconomic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and\nthat West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the\nworld economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade\ndeficit.\n    \"There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and\nI don't know who's going to be rolled over,\" de Vries said. He\ncalled for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options\nas alternatives to pure new money.\n    \"Can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?\"\nhe asked the conference.\n    But new ideas take time to devise and implement, and\nBrazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the\naptience of debtors might be wearing thin.\n    Persio Arida, a former director of the Brazizlian central\nbank who was a key architect of that country's Cruzado plan to\ncurb inflation, said there is an \"incentive problem\" throughout\nLatin America.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community's (EC)\nexecutive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its\nambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm\nsurpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.\n    Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and\nDenmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which\nhas already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led\nby the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.\n    But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told\njournalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the\ntax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual\nfarm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's\nbudget.\n    He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind\nup for good. \"I hope the debate is still open, if not there will\nbe a formidable hole in the budget,\" he said.\n    The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and\nwould be only slightly less this year, he said.\n    Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead\nof farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as\nunprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers\nrecognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.\n    The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra\ncash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels\nand to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by\nmaking it more competitive with other oils.\n    Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil\nproducers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the\ntax.\n    \"What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better\nunderstood not just outside the community but at home,\" he said.\n    Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the\nEC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to\nimpose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats\ncould seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other\ncountries.\n    Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing\ncountries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.\n    The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle\nMonetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border\nsubsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations\nfor farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.\n    In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC\nexecutive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear\nsuch a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.\n    Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at\nthe talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had\nbeen alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of\nthe Commission's farm price proposals, he added.\n   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the\nEC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese\nopposition.\n    The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of\nunwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it\ninto animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.\n    National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of\nsavings from another plan to curb milk production.\n    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the\nscheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive\nsurpluses built up before they joined the community last year,\nbut the two countries did not block today's vote.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier.\n    The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to\n57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to\nthe continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index\nwas down 29 pct from a year earlier.\n    The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February,\nits 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in\nprices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to\nsevere sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added\nto the decline.\n    The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier.\n    The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of\n7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling\nsuch statistics in 1960 under its current system.\n    Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as\nhigher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected,\nthe bank said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

They also share responsibility\nfor finding lasting solutions.\"\n    Local officials have payed great importance to\nWeizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer of\nmore flexible repayment terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr\nforeign debt, Latin America's third largest.\n    Weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him by\nPresident Raul Alfonsin at Buenos Aires' City Council hall,\nalso said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacle\nposed by the foreign debt to countries like Argentina.\n    \"Democracy in Latin America must not be endangered because\nof misery or new injustices,\" he said.\n    Argentine officials said they might halt debt payments last\nmonth if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlr\nloan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11\nbanks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure\nthe loan.\n    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with the\nEuropean Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain\nexports.\n    \"We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of\nbalanced interest from all parties,\" he said.\n    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly\ninto the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.\n    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a Latin\nAmerican tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala. He held\nbrief talks on Sunday with Brazilian President Jose Sarney\nduring a stopover in Brasilia.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The EC's executive\nCommission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion\nEcus, about 70 pct more than the last aid deal, but West\nGermany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct.\n    The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the\nEC, while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in\nloans from the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term\ninvestment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed\nwill be worked out by EC officials.\n    Syria, while still officially included on the list, will\nnot receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to\nit. The EC last year imposed sanctions against Syria because of\nits alleged role in the attempted bombing of an Israeli\nairliner.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Even some senior\nexecutives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the\nfreeze in interviews with Tanjug.\n    The agency said strikes took place last week in the\nsouthern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic\nAlbanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia\nand Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in\nBelgrade refused to take their paychecks.\n    Earlier, Yugoslav journalists, who asked to remain\nanonymous, told Reuters they had been barred from strike-hit\nfactories.\n    They said they had been told they could not enter without\npermits, whereas before the strikes no permits had been\nnecessary to visit factories.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But the result is expected\nto be a change from the outgoing centre-left coalition.\n    Political commentators said the results will have\nfar-reaching implications as they showed a significant swing\nfrom the left, which has dominated post-war Finnish politics.\n    Despite the Conservative revival, commentators said there\nwould be no immediate change in foreign policy, which is\nmoulded by Finland's sensitive position in the shadow of the\nneighbouring Soviet Union.\n    The environmentalist \"Greens\" doubled their seats in\nparliament to four, although opinion polls had forecast they\nwould win 10.\n    The Communists split for the first time into pro-Moscow\nStalinists and Eurocommunists. The Eurocommunists retained\ntheir 17 seats, while the Stalinists, expelled from the\nofficial Communist Party in 1986, lost six of their 10 seats.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It has not yet said what kind of cars it will make.\n    The sources did not say when BOI would announce its\ndecision on the Toyota application.\n    In 1984 Toyota severed its ties with <Delta Motor Corp>,\nits local partner for more than 20 years, because the latter\nwas suffering financial difficulties. The state-owned\nPhilippine National Bank later foreclosed on Delta's assets and\nthe sources said Toyota is now negotiating to buy these.\n    The government sources also said Toyota was in the final\nstages of negotiations with a new local partner.\n    Toyota would be the third participant in the PCMP, joining\n<Pilipinas Nissan Inc> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing\nCorp>, formerly Canlubang Automotive Resources Corp.\n    Two U.S. Car firms, General Motors Corp <GM.N> and Ford\nMotor Co <F.N>, withdrew from the local car market shortly\nafter the country was hit by a financial crisis in 1983.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,\nand operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan\ntakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris\naccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.\n    \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of\n150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer\nat one leading bank said.\n    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at\naround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a\nmeeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.\n    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,\nbut a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed\ninflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.\nTreasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.\n    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package\nJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its\ntrade surplus significantly, and said such measures would\nprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.\n    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of\nmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost\ndomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.\n    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition\nboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition\nof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim\nchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near\nfuture, the dealers said.\n    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the\nU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on\nthe dollar, they said.\n    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed\nsince before the Paris accord, they added.\n    \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to\na still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt\ncrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest\npayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the\nReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms\nscandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.\n    \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to\naround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank\nTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.\n    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way\nfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.\n    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.\nFederal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for\nquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar\nwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.\n    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London\nwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.\n    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central\nbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline\nbecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying\nintervention as a chance to sell dollars.\n    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch\nassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not\nshow drastic movement at least to the end of March.\"\n    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any\nstrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books\nfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar\nwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on\ntheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in\npurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.\n    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any\ncomments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Australian dollar rose more than 40\npoints and money market interest rates retreated on the better\nthan expected improvement in the February current account\ndeficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about\nidentifying it as the start of a downward trend.\n    The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in\nFebruary from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion\ndlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.\n    The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as\nhigh as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.\n    \"It's got 69 cents written all over it,\" one dealer said.\n    Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on\nthe dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30\npoints to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.\n    The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts\nand analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one\nbillion dlrs for March.\n    Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter\nNicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and\ninterest rates were too high for import substitution and export\nindustries.\n    Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875\nand perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.\n    <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said\nthe 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at\n2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.\n    But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal\nexports remained poor. \"We should remember we are paying\nsomething like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service\nour foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near\nterm,\" Buttrose said.\n    Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln\ndlrs, and added \"Any figure under a billion dollars will be\nacceptable (to the markets).\"\n    ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little\nsaid the big question was whether the improvement in exports\ncould be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion\ndlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.\n    Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with\n90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early\nhighs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.\n    Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct\nfrom 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.\n    The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said\nthe current account data had little impact on trading.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

They also said they\nwere disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that\nwould impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were\nprepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already\ndistanced itself from the bill.\n    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written\nto his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,\noutlining the EC's concerns.\n    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.\nMoves towards protectionism. \"The adoption of such measures\nwould not fail to have a negative effect on the process of\nmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral\nrelations,\" it said.\n    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but\nto react according to the laws of the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade, it said.\n    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said\nthey \"deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in\ntrade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.\"\n    The statement said the EC would continue to insist that\nJapan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.\n    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a\nreport on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them\nto take appropriate action where necessary.\n    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers\nwere determined not to let the Japanese question drop. \"It will\nbe back on the table again and again,\" the diplomat said.\n    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,\n\"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the\nCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan.\"\n    The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its\ntrade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approach\non imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it has\nimposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties.\n    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo\nto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and\ndamaging trade war, and the ministers called for more\ncooperation with Japan in industry and research.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Buoyed by low fuel prices and\nfavourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's\n<CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's\nforecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.\n    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings\nof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports\nresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company.\n    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, made\nits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in\nMay last year.\n    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making\na total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the\nprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    They said the airline's performance improved in the second\nhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln\ndlrs.\n    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one\nU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's\nfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time\nof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.\n    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline\nindustry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the\n1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would\naffect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits\nof 1.25 billion dlrs.\n     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and\ncurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.\n    \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed\nthat profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of\nMansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.\n    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier\nlevels, but profits rose 69 pct.\n    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on\nthe company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices\nusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,\nanalysts said.\n    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the\nHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and\nsterling 12 pct.\n    \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against\nCathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields\nin the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should\ncontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields to\nend the year up 7.6 pct.\"\n    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash\nunder management also improved profits, James Capel said.\n    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed\nto Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor\ndeclined because of increased competition and an expansion of\nits fleet and services.\n    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown\nlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown\nclimbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell\nto 68.8 pct from 70 pct.\n    \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes\nlast year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\"\nsaid Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"\n    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <Hong\nKong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's\ndecision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Capital expenditure of about 18 mln\ndlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.\n    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a\nmajor employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast\nof Tasmania.\n    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10\nmln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr\nadvance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions\nand deferred royalties and payroll taxes.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by <News Ltd>,\nan Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd <NCPA.S>.\n    Production and administration of the two publications would\nbe transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. INL\nsaid the acquisition took effect on March 1.\n    INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the\nsubsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine\ncommunity newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston\narea. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult\nbecause the city's economy depends to a large extent on the\nfortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should\nimprove in the medium to long term and the investment will\nprove to be sound, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Even with Insat 1C's\nlaunch by Ariane in the first quarter of 1988, we will still be\nin trouble because the life of Insat 1B ends in 1989,\" Rao said.\n    He said India plans to send up Insat 1D as soon as possible\nas a backup for Insat 1C, but will have to wait for a place on\na NASA or Ariane launch vehicle. \"We can't use Soviet vehicles\nbecause the satellites are made in the United States,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy\ncourt will hear its request today for a restraining order to\nstop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by <TransAmerican\nNatural Gas Corp>.\n    TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nproceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit\nto block Coastal from taking control.\n    Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which\nis an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its\nown reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.\n    Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves\nand pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an\nundisclosed amount.\n    TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values\nits total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about\none billion dlrs.\n    The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in\nTexas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and\nover 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.\n    About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot\nmarket sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.\n    Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay\nits 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The\nlawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one\nbillion in punitive damages from Coastal.\n    Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market\nsince 1979, when it was forced to sell <Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering\nCo> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas\ncustomers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.\n    Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,\nearned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about\nhalf the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Only if there is a major disaster will we become a\nmajor importer.\"\n    A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports\nwould rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,\nlow world prices and rising domestic demand for human and\nanimal consumption.\n    \"At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain\nit exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly\nneeds,\" the trader said.\n    The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is\naffecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce\nthe summer grain harvest from last year's level.\n    The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying\nenough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it\ndifficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln\ntonnes against 391 mln in 1986.\n    \"All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest\narea, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and\nhigh-yield cash crops,\" it said.\n    It added factory production might have to be reduced to\nprovide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight\nthe drought.\n    Since January, the press has devoted much attention to\ngrain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's\neconomic and political stability and that prices paid to\nfarmers are too low.\n    Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain\nproduction is a key state policy and outlined the measures\nbeing taken in their areas to encourage output.\n    The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of\nthe pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise\nagriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set\naside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the\n70,000 workers available to help farmers.\n    Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside\nShanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three\nyears unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.\n    Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of\nZhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain\noutput in his province.\n    \"In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,\nraising the level of science and technology on the farms and\nimproving the supply of raw materials, roads and other\ninfrastructure,\" he said.\n    The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in\nindustry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their\nspare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,\nthey lease the land to grain farmers.\n    The China Daily said last month that grain output should\nreach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480\nand 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made\nprofitable.\n    \"The advantages the state promises grain growers actually\nyield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by\nintermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.\nOnly this will boost enthusiasm,\" it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan's gross national product (GNP) rose\na real 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter after an\nupwardly revised 0.7 pct increase the previous three months,\nthe Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.\n    The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been\nput at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2\npct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.\n    In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7\npct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst\nsince 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the\nstrong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.\n    In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December\nquarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in\nthe previous three months, the Agency said.\n    Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December,\nafter a one pct rise the previous quarter.\n    Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real\nGNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2.\nThe figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.\n    In July/September, domestic demand contributed one\npercentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off\n0.3 point.\n    Of the 0.2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last\nquarter, falling exports knocked off 0.2 while falling imports\ncontributed 0.4 point.\n    Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter in\nOctober/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct.\n    Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to\nOctober/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for\n0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.\n    The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for\nhousebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for\nstockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Schlumberger Ltd's <SLB.N> decision to\nend an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> to buy\n80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political\nfurore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese\ncompanies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High\ntechnology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry\nanalysts said.\n    The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to\nFujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by\nthe Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.\n    \"The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's\nNorth American operations, but it would have been a great\nboost,\" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.\n    French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending\nthe agreement because mounting political controversy in the\nU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake\ncould be completed in a reasonable time.\n    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and\nDefence Department, partly on national security grounds.\n    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the\nJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North\nAmerican sales and distribution system and access to\nmicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,\nanalysts said.\n    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional\nmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the\nU.S., A report by the Capel firm said.\n    \"It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a\nmarketing channel for other things,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd\nanalyst Rick May.\n    Several analysts said the purchase would not have given\nFujitsu access to critical defence technology.\n    \"(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a\nthing of the past,\" May said.\n    The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as\nit might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to\nmodernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.\n    The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese\nfirms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High\ntech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.\n    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly\nroute of expanding its own production and distribution\nfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the\nestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to\nacquire some less politically symbolic firm.\n    \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the\nnecessity of expanding their production and design capacity in\nAmerica remains,\" said Capel's Murtha. \"The Japanese will\ncontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find\nones that are politically acceptable.\"\n    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or\nsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash\nthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They're not\ngoing to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...\nBecause of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete's May.\n    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct\nshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super\nminicomputer makers, he said.\n    Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up\nharming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational\ntie-ups, some analysts said.\n    \"This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,\" said\nJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. \"The\npooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --\nwhy should the government step in to prevent it?\"\n    Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime\nTamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.\nGovernment officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.\n    \"This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter\nfor governments' comment,\" Tamura said. \"I think it was improper\nfor U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they\ndid,\" he said.\n    A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that\ninternational investment flows ought to be free and that such\nflows are of increasing importance in line with the growing\ncloseness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It said it hoped\nto narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by\n1991.\n    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45\nbillion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two\nmonths of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.\n    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to\nimport Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.\n    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one\nstep short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea\nto the negotiating table and stop the plan.\n    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import\nrestrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean\ngoods to help reduce the trade deficit.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

At present, the standard or\nbottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is\n1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.\n    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from\ndairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is\n1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540\nyen per kilo and the ceiling 760.\n    They said the domestic beef intervention price influences\nimported beef selling prices on the domestic market.\n    Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government\nbody imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or\nprocessors in line with the standard price of other beef\ncategories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef\nprices, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The tariff for U.S. Fiscal year 1987/88 is\nset at 14.5 pct.\n    They said the U.S. Planned to cut the tariff to 4.4 pct for\nfiscal 1988/89, but that the higher level is likely to be kept\nfor a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Zambia has stopped sending its copper\nexports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia\nsaid.\n    The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as\nsaying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)\nwas diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but\nit did not say which alternative routes were being used.\n    ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but\nStandwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia\nRailway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all\nZambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA\nline to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.\n    During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped\nthrough Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only\nother available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.\n    Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian\nmineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he\nadded.\n    Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to\n98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President\nKenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital\nfor his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the\ntraditional route through South Africa.\n    Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in\neconomic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an\ninterview on March 1, \"My main concern, of course, is the mines\nbecause whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.\"\n    According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of\nfreight last year and is still working well below its present\n1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been\ncompleted for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and\ndependable routes his government would look to increase its\nusage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.\n    The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal\nMarketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal\nexports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus\n79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell\nto 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.\n    Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's\nexport routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed\nreservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira\nports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they\ncould be hauled there by train.\n    \"The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form\nhandle the huge exports of Zambian copper,\" one western diplomat\nsaid.\n    \"A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets\ncould be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports\nwhich lack the facilities and space to handle the copper\ntonnage,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Britain's Public Sector Borrowing\nRequirement (PSBR) showed a provisional net repayment of 300\nmln stg in February, compared with an unrevised 3.7\nbillion stg repayment in January, the Treasury said.\n    This gives a cumulative PSBR in the first 11 months of the\ncurrent fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billion\nrequirement in the like period last year.\n    The government's forecast for the PSBR in fiscal 1986/87 is\n7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot on\nthis number. The February data was within market forecasts.\n    The Central Government Borrowing Requirement on its own\naccount in February was a net repayment of 100 mln stg after a\nunrevised net repayment of 3.4 billion stg in January. In the\nfirst 11 months, the central government borrowing on its own\naccount was 2.3 billion stg, after 2.1 billion in January.\n    Local Authorities made a repayment estimated at 100 mln stg\nin February. The cumulative local authorities' repayment for\nthe first 11 months was 700 mln. The Treasury said the fall\nabout 2.5 billion stg in the cumulative PSBR at this point this\nyear over last was largely due to lower public corporation and\nlocal authority borrowing. This was also the case last month,\nit said.\n    The Public Corporations' Borrowing Requirement is estimated\nat minus 400 mln stg, to give a cumulative repayment of 1.4\nbillion stg.\n    The local authority and public sector surplus on the 11\nmonths cumulative basis was 2.1 billion, compared with a flat\nposition at the same stage last year.\n    The Treasury said that the proceeds from privatisation of\n<British Airways Plc> reduced requirements by 400 mln stg.\n    The Treasury said the General Government Borrowing\nRequirement is estimated to be a net repayment of 100 mln stg\nin February, giving a cumulative requirement of 1.1 billion.\n    Consolidated fund revenue was 8.8 billion stg in February,\ngiving a cumulative total of 101.4 billion in the first 11\nmonths, 4.5 pct up from the like stage last year.\n    Inland Revenue Receipts for the first 11 months were 1.8\nbillion stg, or 3.5 pct higher than a year earlier. Receipts\nfrom Customs and Excise were 3.5 billion stg in the first 11\nmonths, 10.5 pct higher than in the previous year.\n    The Treasury said that budget forestalling, when traders\nbring in goods in advance of today's annual budget, brought in\n300 mln stg more in customs and excise receipts than in\nFebruary 1986.\n    Consolidated fund expenditure was 8.4 billion stg in\nFebruary, with a cumulative 102.5 billion for the first 11\nmonths, four pct higher than in the previous year.\n    Supply expenditure was provisionally estimated at 8.3\nbillion stg in February, giving a cumulative total of 91.2\nbillion or three pct above last year's equivalent total.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

About 60\npct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial\nfarmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.\n    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries\nsince 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food\nshortage in Zimbabwe.\n    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000\ntonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,\nwhich means that even with the sharply reduced production this\nyear Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.\n    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a\n25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from\n248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean\ndeliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.\n  REUTER\n\u0003",

This\ncontrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.\n    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was\na drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined\n12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous\nyear. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing\nproduction increased 1.4 pct.\n    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to\n8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP\ndeflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no\ngrowth in real output during 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bankers in Saudi Arabia are negotiating\na delicate balance between western business practice and\noriental justice as they try to restructure the troubled\ncorporate sector's debt.\n    The problem lies in reconciling Saudi Arabia's\nwestern-style banking system and an Islamic, \"Sharia\" legal\nsystem in which interest payments may be viewed as usury and\nillegal.\n    So Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks have pinned hopes on\nnegotiated settlements rather than enforced ones, and are\nresigned to not being able to recoup loans in full.\n    And they have become highly selective over enterprises\neligible for new credit after a run of failures that forced\nheavy loan loss provisions and ate relentlessly into profits.\n    As a result, they have attracted complaints from a business\ncommunity that says it is starved of funds while the government\nis criticising it for not playing a larger role in the economy.\n    The private sector's downturn began in earnest in 1983 as\noil prices slid and some companies were slow to react,\nbusinessmen said. Bloated inventories and in some cases poor\nmanagement created problems. Some also blamed the government\nfor not paying for public sector contracts promptly.\n    Long negotiations to reschedule some debt are now producing\nresults. One banker said, \"Banks are agreeing reschedulings, but\noften at a high price... They are resigned to the fact that\nfull recovery (of loans) is not always possible.\"\n    In a few cases private sector firms have been stripped of\nassets during or prior to debt renegotiations, leaving banks\nvirtually no hope of repayment in full.\n    The first major rescheduling was not sealed until\nmid-February this year when <Arabian Auto Agency>, known as\nAAA, reached agreement to stretch out repayments of 700 mln\nriyals of debt to some 50 Saudi and international banks.\n    Bankers said the deal for the Jeddah-based heavy equipment\nimporter is likely to set a precedent for the private sector.\nIt was greeted with relief after 18 months of negotiations.\n    AAA's rescheduling has been followed in the last few days\nby a draft accord on the 1.3 billion riyal debt of one of the\nKingdom's most publicised companies, <Saudi Research and\nDevelopment Corp>, REDEC. These two cases have raised hopes\nthat other companies will also reach agreement soon.\n    Bankers said the cement importer <Arabian Bulk Trade>, and\nthe construction and trading firm <Ali and Fahd Shobokshi\nGroup> are still negotiating with creditor banks.\n    They are increasingly resigned to there being little legal\nrecourse in Saudi Arabia, and that rescheduling with payments\ngeared to a company's cash-flow -- often very low -- is the\nonly way to recover at least a portion of outstanding loans.\n    Though bankers feel they generally have the tacit backing\nof the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Kingdom's\ncentral bank, some say it should take a more active role.\n    However, bankers said it is encouraging SAMA has not\nblocked a \"black list\" of borrowers banks have drawn up and\ncirculated for over a year.\n    Bankers said the AAA accord, negotiated by a committee led\nby <Saudi British Bank>, is a likely model in that banks have\nnot insisted on full repayment of all obligations.\n    Sixty pct of the debt will be repaid in monthly instalments\nover seven years at 1/4 point over Bahrain interbank offered\nrates (BIBOR). The remaining 40 pct is only to be paid after\ncompletion of the first tranche, also at 1/4 over BIBOR. And\naccrued interest on the 40 pct will be waived as long as the\nfirst tranche is met in full.\n    As one banker put it, \"Many banks took the view it was\nbetter to get some money back rather than none at all.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Norway's parliament has approved an\nextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a\nkey loophole through which controversial oil shipments on\nNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.\n    The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late\nSeptember to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.\n    Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on\nNorwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception\nfor ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As\noil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the\ndoor will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.\n    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct\nof its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade\nhas dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,\ntrade ministry officials said.\n    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South\nAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight\nmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns\nfrom the year-ago figure.\n    The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for\nformal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Even some senior\nexecutives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the\nfreeze in interviews with Tanjug.\n    The agency said strikes took place last week in the\nsouthern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic\nAlbanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia\nand Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in\nBelgrade refused to take their paychecks.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,\nand operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan\ntakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris\naccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.\n    \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of\n150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer\nat one leading bank said.\n    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at\naround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a\nmeeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.\n    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,\nbut a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed\ninflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.\nTreasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.\n    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package\nJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its\ntrade surplus significantly, and said such measures would\nprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.\n    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of\nmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost\ndomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.\n    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition\nboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition\nof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim\nchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near\nfuture, the dealers said.\n    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the\nU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on\nthe dollar, they said.\n    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed\nsince before the Paris accord, they added.\n    \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to\na still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt\ncrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest\npayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the\nReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms\nscandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.\n    \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to\naround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank\nTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.\n    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way\nfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.\n    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.\nFederal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for\nquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar\nwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.\n    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London\nwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.\n    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central\nbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline\nbecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying\nintervention as a chance to sell dollars.\n    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch\nassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not\nshow drastic movement at least to the end of March.\"\n    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any\nstrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books\nfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar\nwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on\ntheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in\npurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.\n    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any\ncomments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

However, the\ndecline in the market made it appear that they could no longer\njustify the overhead.\n    The official said Orion would redeploy the three traders\nwho had been in the FRN sector, mostly to their Euro-commercial\npaper operation, an area the bank believes has a greater growth\npotential.\n    Officials at several other firms, who also declined to be\nidentified, said they were reviewing their position to decide\nwhether to continue making markets in FRNs.\n    In trading earlier today, traders said prices of several\ndated FRNs had firmed slightly and that some buyers were\nbeginning to re-enter the market.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The World Bank is expected to approve a\n310 mln dlr economic recovery loan for the Philippines at a\nmeeting of its executive board today in Washington, Central\nBank sources said.\n    The sources said the loan, agreed upon in principle last\nSeptember during a visit to the United States by President\nCorazon Aquino, had been held up by Philippine government\ndelays in fulfilling key conditions.\n    They said the documents required by the World Bank were not\nsubmitted by Manila until late February.\n    The sources said the loan is needed to rehabilitate the the\nstate-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the Development\nBank of the Philippines (DBP), which together are burdened with\nseven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.\n    They said the World Bank had insisted the two banks appoint\nindependent auditors and draft revised charters.\n    It also laid down several conditions for an Asset\nPrivatisation Trust (APT) planned by the government to dispose\nof the banks' unproductive assets, the sources said.\n    The APT, set up in January, is headed by banker and\nbusinessman David SyCip.\n    The sources said the World Bank wanted respected private\nsector individuals to be appointed to the APT, and immunity\nfrom prosecution for the trust. It wanted a clause saying\nbuyers of non-performing assets could not be prosecuted.\n    The Manila Standard newspaper quoted Rolando Arrivillaga,\nWorld Bank representative in the Philippines, as saying the\nloan would be in three 100 mln dlr tranches. The first tranche\nwould be available late this month or in early April.\n    Arrivillaga said the remaining 10 mln dlrs was in the form\nof technical assistance available for disbursement during a\n36-month period.\n    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said approval of the\nloan will trigger another 300 mln dlr loan expected from the\nExport-Import Bank of Japan.\n    The Central Bank sources said negotiations would start in\nApril on another 150 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to\nimplement reforms in the government corporate sector.\n    The sources said the World Bank is expected to approve the\nloan by August, after a review of the government's\nnon-financial institutions. The government's 14 major\ncorporations rely heavily on budgetary support to supplement\nexternal borrowing to meet their yearly revenue shortfalls.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11\nbanks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure\nthe loan.\n    Weizsaecker said Argentina has had difficulties with the\nEuropean Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain\nexports.\n    \"We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of\nbalanced interest from all parties,\" he said.\n    Argentina has said the barriers and subsidies cut unfairly\ninto the country's traditional markets for its grain exports.\n    Weizsaecker arrived for a four-day visit, opening a Latin\nAmerican tour which includes Bolivia and Guatemala.

Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety\nof its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla\ngroup, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July\n1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.\n    High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have\nbeen cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.\n    \"We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can't\nexpect any company to remain operating with losses,\" the\nspokesman said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The\nstrikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,\nand further delays would do even more damage,\" Zeebregts said.\n    The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general\ncargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans\nfor 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce\nby 1990, starting with 350 this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Japanese economy will remain sluggish\nin the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for\n12 years in 1986, private economists said.\n    Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,\nwas likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and\nbusiness investment would help sustain the economy this year,\nthe economists said.\n    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency\nreport today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec\nquarter for the first time in 12 years.\n    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real\n0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the\nprevious quarter.\n    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from\n4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst\nperformance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake\nof the first oil crisis.\n    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in\nconsumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was\nonly temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had\ndepressed retail sales.\n    But most private economists disagreed and said consumers\nwere likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw\ntheir real income level off.\n    \"Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or\nheating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but\nthey have done so because they have become even more uneasy\nabout their future pay rises,\" said Shoji Saito, general manager\nof Mitsui Bank's economic research division.\n    He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of\n falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit\nhard by the yen's rise.\n    Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said\nweakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.\nWithout brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve\ndomestically generated economic growth as the government has\nput a lid on fiscal measures, he said.\n    Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in\nOct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including\nexceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen\nTakahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,\nsaid the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec\nresulted from an issue of gold coins.\n    \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that\nhigh level of public-sector consumption in the following\nquarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending\nwould have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which\nmarked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.\n    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current\nquarter given the lack of additional significant government\nspending and sluggish consumer spending.\n    Saito said the most effective government action would be\nincome tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a\nproposed controversial sales tax.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Forecasts had\ngenerally been for a net repayment in February, but the 300 mln\nstg repayment was toward the better end of expectations.\n    March is usually a high-spending month, boosting the 11\nmonth figure at the end of the fiscal year. Nevertheless,\nLawson is expected to downwardly revise the 1986/87 PSBR later\ntoday.\n    Until now, only the more optimistic forecasts put Lawson's\nroom for manoeuvre as great as six billion stg for 1987/88,\nwith many favouring a four billion of five billion package.\n    But Bill Martin, economist at brokers Phillips and Drew,\nsaid a six billion stg adjustment now looks within range, split\nbetween three billion off the PSBR and three billion off taxes.\n    Malcolm Roberts, of Salomon Bros International, also said\nsix billion was within a credible range of forecasts.\n    Roberts added that he was now expecting Lawson to have at\nleast five billion stg available following this morning's data,\nagainst his own previous estimates of around four billion.\n    He said today's 11 month PSBR figure was genuinely low,\nrather than distorted by unusual factors, which fuels pressure\non Lawson to reduce next year's borrowing target. However, he\nforecast a March 1987 PSBR of 3.5 billion stg.\n    Peter Fellner, of brokers James Capel, cautioned that six\nbillion still looks on the high side of expectations.\n    \"Something like 4.5 (billion) or so is still more realistic,\"\nhe said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Copper shares, which have lagged\nbehind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger\ndemand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.\n    \"Copper prices should move up over the next four to six\nquarters,\" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>. \"I\nsee average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from\naround 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world\neconomic growth.\"\n    Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a\npound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.\n    Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp <PD> will be a strong\nperformer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.\n    But Asarco Inc <AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from\ncopper, and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> are also potential\nwinners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its\ncopper operations to its shareholders.\n    \"In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play\nand benefits most from higher copper prices,\" one said.\n    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,\nsaid Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining\noperations. \"They've accomplished a great deal,\" he said.\n    The company's move into carbon black, a product used in\ntires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid\ngrowth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.\nHe estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs\nin 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.\n    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.\n    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and\nfour dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this\nyear and around 3.50 dlrs next year.\n    \"The stock can go to the mid 30s,\" Roling said, from its\ncurrent level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.\n    \"Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need\ncopper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,\" said\nVahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. \"The shares will\noutperform the market over the next 18 months,\" he said.\n    But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says\nNewmont Mining is a more attractive investment. \"We'd rather\nplace our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a\nsignificant premium to the current stock price,\" he said.\n    After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will\nhave gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co\n<NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,\nToufexis noted.\n    Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in\n1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40\ndlrs from operations in 1986.\n    \"I'd be buying up to 90,\" Toufexis said last week, when the\nstock rose sharply to near that level. \"But the shares are\nprobably worth about 108 dlrs (each).\"\n    Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like\nAsarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison\nsees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses\nin 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and\nfrom three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.\n    Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co\n<CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in\ncoal and other minerals aside from copper.\n    But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced\nat current levels. \"I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy\nPhelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. banks are under pressure to\nmeet vigorous competition, but Congress continues to duck hard\nchoices on banking law reform that could benefit consumers.\n    Supporters say deregulating banking will increase\ncompetition, offer consumers more choices and bring lower fees\nfor financial services and home mortgage interest rates.\n    But the Senate Banking Committee last week put off until\nlater in the year decisions on pressing issues such as whether\nbanks could enter new businesses like underwriting corporate\ndebt and selling insurance and real estate.\n    The committee also reined in banks' competitors, the\nso-called nonbank banks, which elude the technical definition\nof a bank because they do not both accept deposits and make\nloans. The committee meeting room became a battleground for\ngiants of the financial industry -- banks, brokerages,\ninsurance firms, retail and industrial corporations -- with but\nlittle consideration given to the consumer.\n    The lobbies backed various amendments to protect their turf\nand a bill that rescues a federal deposit insurance fund for\nthrift institutions and puts a moratorium on any changes in\nbanking law was passed and sent on to the full Senate.\n    The House of Representatives has yet to act.\n    Behind the political deals was the larger question whether\nCongress would end or modify the half-century-old separation of\ncommercial and investment banking or leave it alone.\n    One argument in support of change is that fees for\nfinancial services would come down if Congress expands banks'\npowers.\n    Lower fees to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, for\nexample, could lead to lower interest rates on home mortgages,\nsupporters say.\n    \"A lot of nonbanking firms have used loopholes to get into\nbanking, but banks have not be allowed into any new businesses,\"\nsays Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.\n    \"We have been seeing a gigantic turf war,\" says Litan, who\nfavors new powers for banks if deposits are safeguarded.\n    The swirl of corporate mergers and the financial\ninformation explosion have blurred the distinction between the\nactivities of banks and security brokerages.\n    On a wider horizon, U.S. financial institutions face\nstepped-up competition from financial centers like London and\nTokyo in international transactions.\n    West German and Japanese banking is more concentrated in a\nfew, large banks, while most European countries allow banking\nand securities to be mixed.\n    All these forces put pressure on U.S. financial firms to\nadapt to change, but the congressional debate over reform drags\non. The committee's bill put a freeze on any changes and its\nchairman, Senator William Proxmire, promised to return the\nissues in October. If approved by Congress, the bill would\npostpone applications before the Federal Reserve for new powers\nto three of the largest banks -- Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and\nBankers Trust.\n    Other industries where regulatory barriers have fallen have\nexperienced lower fees, the emergence of new players and\naccelerated innovation.\n    But these advances in airlines, trucking, and\ntelecommunications have not been without drawbacks. Companies\nthat were slow to adapt disappeared under the new competitive\nregime, while the public faced a bewildering number of new\nchoices. The Reagan administration favors bank reform.\n    The traditional method companies use to raise funds --\nborrowing from banks -- has given way to selling corporate debt\nand other new securities that are off limits to banks.\n    But critics say the soundness of the banking system created\nby such laws as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act would be\nundermined.\n    Banks are treated as special and shielded from the\nmarketplace's vagaries by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nThe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) performs\nthe same function for thrifts.\n    The one issue the committee did act on which benefits\nconsumers is new funding for the federal insurance fund for\ndeposits at savings and loan associations, which has fallen to\nits lowest ratio of reserves to deposits in history.\n    Despite efforts toward change in Congress, a ban on\ninterstate banking remains.\n    The barriers are crumbling anyway because state\nlegislatures are agreeing to permit bank mergers across state\nlines within a region.\n    Congress is proceeding cautiously, having in mind the\nbanking industry's tribulations in the early 1930's.\n    But some say it is moving too cautiously for banks to keep\npace with what is happening in business here and around the\nworld.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community (EC) yesterday\nwarned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,\nthat friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations\nwith both countries.\n    EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's\ncontinued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make\na greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they\nwere disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that\nwould impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were\nprepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already\ndistanced itself from the bill.\n    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written\nto his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,\noutlining the EC's concerns.\n    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.\nMoves towards protectionism. \"The adoption of such measures\nwould not fail to have a negative effect on the process of\nmultilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral\nrelations,\" it said.\n    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but\nto react according to the laws of the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade, it said.\n    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said\nthey \"deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in\ntrade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.\"\n    The statement said the EC would continue to insist that\nJapan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.\n    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a\nreport on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them\nto take appropriate action where necessary.\n    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers\nwere determined not to let the Japanese question drop. \"It will\nbe back on the table again and again,\" the diplomat said.\n    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,\n\"There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the\nCommunity concerning trade relations with Japan.\"\n    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo\nto solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and\ndamaging trade war, and the ministers called for more\ncooperation with Japan in industry and research.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Livestock analysts expect renewed bull\nspreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA\n7-state cattle on feed report.\n    The USDA reported high placements in February, which may\nweigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued\nstrong marketings during the month will support the April\ncontract.\n    Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50\ncents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts\nsaid.\n    Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle\non feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom\nO'Hare. \"They have no place to send the grain,\" he said.\n    Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while\nthe current discount of deferred months to the cash market may\noffset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.\n    \"The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,\"\nsaid Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that\neven though placements came in above the average trade guess,\nmany traders had expected high placements.\n    Placements are not that negative, especially since the\ntechnical correction in June and August live cattle futures\nsince last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.\n    He said the current marketing posture will provide added\nsupport to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been\nrunning at a heavier than expected pace.\n    Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with\nthe number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of\nthe year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But\nthe report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year\nago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.\n    \"So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They\n(feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had\nintended for the first quarter, which is a bullish\ndevelopment,\" Levitt said.\n    Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of\nMarch are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling\nbehind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The Cartel Office\"s probe came in the wake of this.\n    The Office had not yet officially contacted Lufthansa, but\nSchoen said the airline would be asked for information about\nthe way fares were decided.\n    It would then be decided if the practice was a breach of\narticle 85 of the EC treaty.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The White House was forced to issue a correction\nfollowing the news conference.\n    Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter with\nreporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his job\napproval rating in various public opinion polls.\n    Since the November 19 news conference, Reagan --who\nmaintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- has\nrevised his position on his covert Iran policy.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Some governments, including Austria, had\nlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues which\nwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.\n    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed\ncredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too\ncostly for frequent use.\n    \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here\ncommented.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,\nsaid U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar\n1987.\n    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of\npayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1\nbillion shortfall in 1986.\n    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this\nyear, Lawson said.\n    \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may\ncontinue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by\nthe summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the\nyear,\" he added.\n    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),\nLawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0\nbillion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.\n    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.\n    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for\nthe narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal\n1987/88.\n    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3\naggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken\ninto account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course\nwill the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament.\n    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is\nchiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax\nrevenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an\nincreasingly profitable business sector in particular.\"\n    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier\nassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per\nbarrel in calendar 1987.\n    He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax\nrevenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the\neconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the\npublic finances in a very strong position.\"\n    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at\n1.0 pct of GDP in future.\n    \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term\nFinancial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0\npct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years\nahead,\" Lawson said.\n    \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this\nyear for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course\nremains a major objective of government policy.\"\n    \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence\nand caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\"\n    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange\nControl Act from the Statute book.\n    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged\nat 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be\ncharged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\"\n    He said that under the new proposed system, companies\nshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments\nagainst tax on capital gains.\n    \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in\n1988/89,\" Lawson said.\n    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building\nsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporation\ntax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after\nthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\"\n    \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new\nmethod of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and\nFile.\"\n    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax\ncollection, and would not come into force until the early\n1990s.\n    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax\n(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct\nof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their\n(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those\nnew fields exceeds the costs incurred.\n    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending\non research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any\nparticular field.\n    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive\ntax relief for retraining workers.\n    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value\nAdded Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax\non the basis of cash paid and received.\n    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of\nquarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being\nextended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds\nare to be raised to 21,300 stg.\n    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.\n    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be\nset at 125,000 stg.\n    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies\nin multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be\nable to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.\nThe change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but \"genuine\ntrading companies\" will not be affected.\n    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit\nrelief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank\nloans, also from April 1.\n    \"In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit\nonly against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,\" he said.\n    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two\npence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.\n    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic\ntaxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added \"given my decision\nto use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to\nreduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.\"\n    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to\n27 pct, he said.\n    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to\nchange the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it\ninto line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities\nmade by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable\nprovisions made by financial traders.\n    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with\nLloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.\n    \"The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the\nLloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,\" Lawson\nsaid.\n MORE\n\u0003",
