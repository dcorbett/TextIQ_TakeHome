Diplomatic\nsources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's\nability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam\nwithout causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.\n    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated\nCopper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in\nJohannesburg, since it was now redundant.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct\nat the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by\nthe summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the\nyear.\n    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged\nwhen compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,\nLawson said.\n    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling\nM3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be\ntaken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as\nthe exchange rate.\n    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to\nthe buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the\ncorporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business\nsector in particular.\n    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier\nassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per\nbarrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the\nPSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Conservative gains in Finnish general\nelections could speed liberalisation of financial markets,\nthough there will not be a radical economic restructuring,\nconservative officials and economic analysts said.\n    The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after\nthe two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political\ncommentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is\nlikely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.\n    International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: \"we are\nwilling to liberalise the economy as much as possible.\"\n    Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition\nhad introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its\nperiod of government between 1983 and 1987.\n    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to\nother European conservative movements and had, for example,\nshelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.\n    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties\nwith its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right\ncoalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.\n   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade\nmust be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January\nagreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.\n    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude\noil accounting for 80 pct of imports.\n    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-\nSoviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim\nexports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.\n    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the\nelection news, with little movement in the markka or on the\nHelsinki stock exchange.\n    Securities analysts said the market would respond positively\nif a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too\nearly to exclude the possibility that social democrats would\nhang on to power.\n    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation\ngoverning the stock market to prevent \"casino-style behaviour.\"\n    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment\nof an internal market between the Nordic countries.\n     International capital markets were becoming more and more\nimportant, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the\ndevelopment of Finland's capial markets.\n   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties\nwith Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be\nstudied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade\nAssociation ( EFTA).\n    Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties\nare likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new\ngovernment will probably not be established before the start of\nApril.\n    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained\nthree to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56\nseats.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the\npossibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France\nduring the interview.\n    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had\nspecifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no\nspecific refinery had been named. She also said that all of\nExxon's opertations were under constant review.\n    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the\nmediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and\nPort Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.\n    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade\njournal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that\nExxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in\nAntwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.\n    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said\nthat with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the\nimprovement in the European refining situation, its future\nprofits there should be good.\n    \"Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of\nrefineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the\nindepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products\nrising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior\nearnings,\" Mlotok said.\n    \"Just after Royal Dutch <RD>, they are seen as one of the\nhighest grade refiners in Europe,\" he added.\n    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to\nfeel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe\nwhere competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as\nthese producers move further into downstream operations.\n    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect\nincreased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export\nrefineries.\n    PIW said \"sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are\nexpected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European\nrefiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last\nyear.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A proposal by two U.S. House\nDemocrats to target government farm benefits to small- and\nmedium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a\nHouse subcommittee today.\n    \"On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,\" said\nRep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. \"This is the\nfirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative\nto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal.\"\n    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron\nDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs\nper bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive\ndeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not\nmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.\n    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20\npct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not\nactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.\n    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five\nyears, protect family farms and eliminate government\naccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be\nhalted.\n    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would\n\"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a\nfamily farmer is.\"\n    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program\npayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.\n    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill\nwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and\ntherefore eligible for payments.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system\nwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15\nper dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.\n    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of\nabout nine kwacha per dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil\nproducers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging\ndevelopments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost\nopportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland\nRevenue said in a post-budget statement.\n    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced\nin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies\nwill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying\ndevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields against\nPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).\n    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an\nindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but was\nnot immediately available against other development\nexpenditure, the statement said.\n    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern\nbasin for which development\nconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve the\npost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies\nto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.\n    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow\ncertain expenditure on oil related research which does not at\npresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT\nliability.\n    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the\nU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a\nparticular field within three years of being incurred, to be\nallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland\nRevenue said.\n    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more\nin line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to\nencourage general research into ways of reducing field\ndevelopment costs, it said.\n    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln\nstg a year, it calculated.\n    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical\nmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.\n    These included measures to allow companies to balance their\nshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two\npast periods of allowance utilisation.\n    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs\nwere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on\ncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the\nso-called \"ring fence\" of activities in the U.K. And its\ncontinental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for\nthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said.\n    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers\nWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs\non PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.\n    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would\nfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields\nsuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.\n    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields\nmight also be encouraged, he said.\n    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore\nconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs\nunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.\n    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the\ndevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin.\n    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the\ncentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than\nin the south and thus have greater capital and labour\nrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.\n    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure\nwould help fundamental research in the oil industry, although\nthe benefits of this research would not be seen for several\nyear.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to\nproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to\nFrench standards.\n    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for\nATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction\nof the French government privatisation laws which reopened\nbidding among a wider range of applicants.\n    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's\nSiemens AG <SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA <SCHN.PA>\nsubsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson\n<ERIC.ST> allied with Matra <MATR.PA> and Bouygues SA\n<BOUY.PA>, Italy's <Italtel>, and Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd\n<NTL.TO>.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "British bank base lending rates are\nlikely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this\nweek following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.\nCentral government borrowing target to four billion stg set in\ntoday's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.\n    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money\nmarkets had already started to reward.\n    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money\nmarket interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget\nmeasures came through, the analysts said.\n    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he\nexpected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.\n    \"This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get\ninterest rates down,\" he said.\n    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely\ndiscounted such a one point cut, with the key three month\ninterbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and\nit would be rather conservative for banks to go for a\nhalf-point cut now.\n    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,\ntoo, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,\nbut this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.\n    \"This budget is designed to please both the markets and the\nelectorate. The implications for interest rates are very\nfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another\nsuch cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said.\n    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he\nsaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut\nin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.\n\"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said.\n    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said\nthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the\nlikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.\n    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,\nin particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the\nsharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point\nbase rate cut could be implemented.\n But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I\nsuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one\npoint off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said.\n    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave\nthe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.\nThis would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer\nprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.\n    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11\npct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money\nand government bonds (gilts) markets.\n    But building societies said they would not cut lending\nrates until base rates had fallen by one full point.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Some governments, including Austria, had\nlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues which\nwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.\n    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed\ncredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too\ncostly for frequent use.\n    \"A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade has been closed today,\" a senior U.S. Official here\ncommented.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Such\ntargets threatened to cause policy conflicts, \"both within\ncountries and between them.\"\n    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund\nits deficits requires interest rates there be set at high\nlevels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.\n    If target zones were established, this would put \"pressure\non other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,\neven though this may be in conflict with their own domestic\nsituation and priorities,\" he said.\n    Gleske added, \"targeting the exchange rate even within a\nwide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a\nclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and\nexternal policy priorities.\"\n    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its\nchances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current\ninterest rate differentials being maintained.\n    These chances \"seem to me to rest critically on the\nexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates,\nand the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth\nfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.\"\n    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had\nlearned \"that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus\ntend to overshoot.\" He said this \"would seem to be unnecessary\nand should be avoided if at all possible.\"\n    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if\nmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will\nlead to balanced international payments, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no\nplans to restructure or to take the company private.\n    Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more\nthan 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his\nstock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said. \n    Articles in two weekly business publications have said\nPlayboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial\nanalysts see as its undervalued asset base.\n    Radomski said there were no corporate developments to\naccount for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but\nthat there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.\n    Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover\nof about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has\ntraded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.\n    The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark\nBoyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs\na share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about\n130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real\nestate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and\nits excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs,\naccording to Business Week.\n    According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion\nand artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share,\nthe Forbes Magazine article said.\n    According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most\nrecognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.\n    Radomski, noting that the articles were written without\ncontact with Playboy, said that \"from time to time people do\nspeculate about the company.\"\n    She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in\nthe \"last day or so\" for a reaction to the articles.\n    American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes\n\"anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged\nbuyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are\nnil.\" Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the\ncompany private, he said.\n    But \"shareholders who held the stock prior to all the\npublicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money,\" he\nsaid.\n    Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value\nof the company is likely to exceed the current price of the\nstock. \"But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take\nmanagement at their word,\" he said.\n    While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a\ndrain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees\npotential. \"They do have a management plan for the cable\noperation and the company as a whole,\" he said. \"Were this plan\nto, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for\nearnings is significant,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs\nlast year.\n    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average\nprice of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the\nprevious year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average\n14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.\n    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average\nof 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it\nhad proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil\nand 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve\nreplacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent\nduring the past three-year period, representing a little more\nthan half of the industry average, the company said.\n    Coastal's more than 800 gasoline retail outlets were\noperated profitably during 1986 \"and are expected to continue\nto do so,\" the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

First, the\nbuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather\nthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.\n    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be\nfree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.\n    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could\ncomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third\nlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager\nwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be\nset by a formula, the delegates said.\n    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met\nbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all\nconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction\nto the scheme and will respond to it when the working group\nmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.\n    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to\nwork from, one consumer delegate said.\n    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for\nnegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Any decision will be\nforwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in\nSaudi Arabia late this year.\n    The six states have different currency systems. Saudi\nArabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the\nInternational Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the\nspecial drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.\n    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while\nKuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by\nitself.\n    The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not\nbeen disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be\nlinked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.\n    Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of\nState for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint\neconomic agreements \"is increasingly linking the interests of\nGCC citizens together.\"\n    The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met\nin Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's\nFinance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim\n    The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic\nand investment projects in the GCC.\n    Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31\nbillion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's budget contained virtually everything the government\nbond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices\nrace ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.\n    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his\nspeech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely\nsharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose\nabout two points on the day.\n    \"This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,\"\nMorgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.\n    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the\nbudget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial\nbank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point\ntomorrow.\n    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection\nof supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget\nwas that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held\nto 4.0 billion stg.\n    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion\nstg.\n    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer\nfar less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and\nthe scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,\nanalysts said.\n    \"The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically\nexpected,\" Bell said. Most market expectations called for the\nChancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.\n    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said\nthat overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less\nin new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in\ntotal new issue volume.\n    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy\nWrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion\nstg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap\nissues.\n    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full\nprice does not have to be paid until the start of the new\nfiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current\nyear's fund raising.\n    But the Bank of England will also be constrained from\nissuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try\nout a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new\nstock.\n    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked\nissue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail\nPrice Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to\nbe raised in the form of traditional stock.\n    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two\npence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line\nwith most market expectations, although some operators had\nexpected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.\n    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,\nShepherd said, because \"If it was more than two pct, they would\nhave become concerned about the economy heating up again.\"\n    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the\nruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut\ncan be offered at budget time next year.\n    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam\non the political implications of the budget which suggests an\nearly election.\n    \"All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the\nmiddle of May,\" Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. \"This makes a June\nelection very likely.\"\n    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from\nthe budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of\nmortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on\npensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.\n    At that rate, they would have been of little use for a\npolitical party expecting to call an election in June.\n    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with\nmeasures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.\n    \"This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour\nparty to attack,\" Shepherd said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The\nworkers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America.\n    A Cominco spokesman, queried by Reuters, declined to\ncomment on whether the company was confident of reaching a new\nagreement before April 30, but said the union had not yet taken\na strike vote.\n    The contracts cover 2,600 production workers at Trail and\nKimberley and 600 office and technical staff at the two\noperations.\n    Trail produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long\ntons of lead in 1986. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced\n2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the\nTrail smelter.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced\nby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.\n    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected\ntomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A\nfollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.\n    \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner,\nU.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It was\na very, very prudent fiscal budget.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a\nwell-balanced budget within the confines of the government's\nphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.\n    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal\nside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.\n    As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\"\nbetween trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg\nfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to\n27 pct.\n    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was\nkept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad\nSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.\n    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for\na half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the\nauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.\nMany analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full\none-point cut tomorrow.\n    \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which\nit will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added a\nfurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.\n    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for\ninflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained\nin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.\n    Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct\nat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result\nfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.\n    \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\"\nhe said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of\nfalling base rates would have an offsetting impact on\ninflation.\n    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but\nit was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said\n    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about\nthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not\ntoo concerned about a revival of inflation.\n    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the\n\"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were\nlikely to be extremely cautious on this front.\n    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest\nrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any\nsigns of excessive weakness.\n    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility\nof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.\n    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from\n1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,\nwhich are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.\nthat the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by\nthe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast\nto be 4.0 billion stg.\n    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any\nclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,\nwhich has to be held before June, 1988.\n    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the\nbenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise\nduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.\n    But others said it kept several options open and it was not\npossible to deduce too much from it.\n    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,\nLawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in\nthat there would be no \"chickens coming home to roost.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June\nelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for\na Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.\n    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost\nto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost\nthree points today as its vice chairman and an investment group\nproposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.\n    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from\nthe stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how\nhigh bidding for the company would go and whether the company\nwould agree to a takeover.\n    \"There are too many uncertainties,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.\n    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital\nInc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they\nwere committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company\nand were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150\ndlrs per share.\n    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted\nto the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been\nmade on a sale of the company.\n    \"Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per\nshare),\" said one arbitrager.\n    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current\nlevels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share\nrange. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level\nwould be chancy since it will take a long time for any\ntransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals\nnecessary for the broadcast properites.\n    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion\ndlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected\nthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,\nits financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives\nsuch as restructuring.\n    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,\nwhich has two large shareholders in an investment group led by\nRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial\nCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds\n16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50\nyears ago, has about 12 pct.\n    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange\nCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.\n    \"I could see if things got really crazy that it might go\nfor 175 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager, but he\nspeculated it probably would not even be taken over for more\nthan a price in the 160s.\n    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he\nspeculated the investor would not really be interested in\nrunning the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.\n    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said\nhe had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged\nbuyout.\n    \"Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all\nthe interests involved,\" he said, adding the two largest\nshareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.\n    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the\ncompany has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest\nestimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the\nlatter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the\nbroadcast industry.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil\nindustry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and\nhead off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend\nto the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic\nPetroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels\nper day.\n    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a\nday.\n    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate\nfor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down\nbecause of budgetary constraints.\n    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might\nadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax\nbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and\ndevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is now\nconsidered uneconomical to produce.\n    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the\nEnergy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.\n    Herrington said that before he disclosed what\nrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry\nhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White House\nEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase\noil production made good tax policy.\n    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one\nmln barrels a day.\n    The report said that by the end of the century the United\nStates may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil\nconsumption, posing a serious economic and national security\nthreat.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "OPEC believes world oil prices should\nbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC\nAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.\n    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar\nin Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: \"OPEC believes\n...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions\nand should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\"\n    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had\ncaused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to\ncurtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC\nstates could not be sustained in some cases.\n    \"For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now\nconsidered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member\ncountries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing\nproduction,\" Al-Wattari said.\n    \"Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\"\nAl-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,\nsome states depended on associated gas output for domestic use\nand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.\n    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the\norganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in\nFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices.\n    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,\nthough restored to a good level, was still under pressure,\nAl-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market\nrequires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added.\n    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a\npolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.\n    But although cutbacks announced by these states were\npolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were\ninsufficient in terms of volume, he added. \"The overall majority\nof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's\ncalls for supply regulation,\" he said.\n    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it\nallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to\ncontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow for\notherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price\nwould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.\n    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also\naddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed\nto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.\n    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous\nfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation\nwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Ecuador would pay back the oil at\na rate of 35,000 bpd.\n    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean\nstate oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company\nnever allows third parties to trade its oil.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The budget presented by Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as\nbeing politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal\nprudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's\nstanding with both voters and financial markets.\n    The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the\nstandard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the\nPublic Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.\n    Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a\nfall in domestic interest rates and an early election.\n    Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget \"is\nnot glamourous - but it is sound and sensible.\"\n    Lawson told journalists later that it was \"a budget built on\nsuccess, for success.\"\n    But opposition MPs did not agree .\n    David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said \"this was a\nstrangely deceptive budget.\n    The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has\nchosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in\nthe SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use\nthose revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty.\"\n    Steel said \"the cunning thing in this seductive budget is\nthat all the good things will come in the pre-election period -\nthe fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the\nlower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes\nand petrol.\"\n    David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)\nwhich with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping,\nsaid \"this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it\nhas failed in its objective. It has given money to the \"haves\" as\nopposed to the \"have-nots.\"\n    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it \"a bribes budget.\"\n    Kinnock said the budget \"had little to do with the general\ngood, and everything to do with the general election.\"\n    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said\n\"the Tories should have used available resources to invest in\nindustry, in health and in education.\"\n    He added that \"we know that whoever is elected (to power in\nthe next general election) will reverse these tax cuts.\"\n    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury\nexpected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for\nuse in cutting taxes or raising public spending.\n    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the\ngovernment would be forced to call an election by a\ndeteriorating economy.\n    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said\nthat \"the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than\nit has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh\nyear of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been\ncombined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and\nstrong, and unemployment is falling.\"\n    He said that \"these are the fruits of the government's\ndetermination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to\nour policies of sound money and free markets.\"\n    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to\nplump for an early election.\n    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would\nhave on election timing, he replied \"I think we will hold the\nelection either late or early. I must confess I am rather\nrelaxed about it all.\n    \"There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.\n    But he added that \"if the Prime Minister decides to go for\nan early election, it will bring to an end all this rather\nridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is\nsomething to be said for that.\"\n    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of\nBritish Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said \"This budget\nwill reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing\nmeans lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI\nwanted.\"\n    \"We have always said we would judge the budget on how it\naffects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct\nnext year.\n    In addition, he said \"they don't have the energy or appetite\nto endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),\"\nwhich he also opposes. \"The real question is where the\nRepublicans will be when the tough vote comes,\" he said.\n    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax\ncredits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or\ntrade bill this year.\n    He added that no extension or expansion of the research and\ndevelopment tax credit for business is expected since it would\ncost billions of dollars.\n    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker\nas Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White\nHouse will ultimately back a tax increase this year. \"There are\nstrong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president\ndown the slippery slope of moderation,\" he said.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Surprisingly strong U.S. housing\nstatistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that\nthe economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient\ncause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,\neconomists said.\n    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually\nmild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\nfirst quarter GNP prospects.\n    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\ncurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\n    \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\nfirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\nsecond,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\nInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

A change in one mln tonnes in\nproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88\nand 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.\n    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now\nestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the\n1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,\ndespite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.\n    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion\nstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the\novershoot.\n    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to\n168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,\nbesides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of\n40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.\n    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5\nbillion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in\n1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,\ncompared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this\nfiscal year.\n    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal\nyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised\n164.9 billion in the current year.\n    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and\noverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public\nSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in\n1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

An\nanalyst familiar with the two mines said \"the properties,\ntogether, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share\nfor Reynolds.\"\n    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise\nin the stock today was likely the result of \"U.S. investors\nthat were not completely cognizant of the size or the\nimportance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia.\"\n    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was\ndiscovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.\nBoddington is principally a bauxite mine.\n    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits\nfrom the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the\nproduction costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.\n    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings\nestimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share\nin 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.\n    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a\nshare, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new\naccounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards\nand other extraordinary items.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The new company will keep the Alcan Aluminium Ltd\nname.\n    Alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the\nadditional shares.\n    The company has said it is undertaking the reorganization\nmainly to streamline management and give Alcan a stronger and\nmore stable financing base by making the new Alcan a major\noperating company as well as a holding and management company.\n    \"In an increasingly global capital market, this new\nstructure should also provide for greater flexibility in\nfinancing the Alcan group,\" the company said.\n    Alcan's current only outstanding securities are common\nshares while the new company would have outstanding securities\nof common, preferred and preference shares, and its debt.\n    Each shareholder would automatically become a shareholder\nin the new company without exchanging share certificates.\n    Alcan later said it has a provision identical to the one\ndetailed in the proxy statement allowing for the issue of\npreferred, common and preference shares, in its existing\ncorporate structure.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Hydro-Quebec, the provincially-owned\nutility, said it is appearing this week before the National\nEnergy Board to defend its application to export about five\nbillion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the New England\nstates.\n    The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in\n1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebec\nutility said hearings are normally held on major contracts up\nto two years after the deal is signed.\n    Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billion\ndlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convince\nthe board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.\n    Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have said\nthey are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and New\nBrunswick utilities said they are objecting because\nHydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going to\nthe New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is also\nconcerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export\nmarkets.\n    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several\nprovinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a\npower agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec\nutility's export contracts.\n    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes\nto contracts in the past but has always left the agreements\nessentially intact.\n    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether\nit believed the board would call for substantial changes to the\nagreement with New England.\n    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last\ntwo or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.\n    Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export\ncontracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed\namounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The House of Representatives\napproved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains\nfarmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at\nleast 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if\nthey did not plant.\n    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers\nin Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed\nby a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.\n    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92\nprovision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.\n    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying\ncrop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed\nbroad-scale revision of farm programs.\n    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from\nplanting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the\ndeficiency payments they would have received.\n    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a\ndifferent crop on that land this spring, although they could\nuse the land for grazing or to plant hay.\n    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,\nlargely because of reduced crop forfeitures.\n    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers\nalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented\nfrom planting crops this year because of residual damage from\nlast fall's flooding.\n    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full\npayment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved\nby Congress last fall.\n    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs\nin appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the\nregion 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.\n    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by\nexpanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart\nefforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an\nalternative to federal disaster assistance.\n    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were\nnarrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option\nto all major commodities and would produce insignificant\nsavings.\n    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers\nwould produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the\nrequirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would\ncost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by\nCongress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln\ndlrs.\n    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln\ndlrs.\n    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987\nwinter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.\n    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to\nwheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling\non the disaster assistance program.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all\nor part of the companies.\n    Independent economists warn that the deficit could push\ninflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the\ngovenment target of 40-50 pct.\n    Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline\nwith a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private\ninvestors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in\neight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.\n    Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said\nthe government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,\nincluding those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock\nexchange.\n    Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the\npossible sale of a company producing palm oil and another\nmanufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold\nin a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern\nstate of  arequipa.\n    Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique\nestremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners\nwould be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries\nsaid they were out of their offices.\n    Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima\nstock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be\nsold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase\nstock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.\n    He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad\nuntil at least july 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\nFT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,\nfeature a main world share index and indices plotting the\nmovement of share prices in different regions and individual\ncountries, the FT said.\n    The first world share indices will be published on an\nup-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of\naround 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.\n    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices\nfor UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and\npublished in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a\nseries of regional indices together with the overall world\nindex.\n    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of\nmeasurements against which the performance of international\nfund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and\nsecurities have been included only when direct holdings of\nshares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said\nto keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of\ncompanies from the U.S. To 600.\n    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -\nthe US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.\n    The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes\ninto account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The\ngross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what\nforeign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding\ntaxes.\n    The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after\nthe enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity\ninvestment in recent years.\nREUTER...^M\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Office of Management and\nBudget does not have a policy position one way or another on\nwhether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate\nprogram should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.\n    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's\nannual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural\nbranch, said instead of an across the board policy for or\nagainst certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work\nvery closely with USDA in determining how many certificates\nshould be sent out in each government farm payment.\n    \"Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the\nCongressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and\ndo increase budget exposure,\" Landis said.\n    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous\nbeneficial impacts.\n    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price\ncompetitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the\ngovernment storage and handling costs.\n    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that\nthey increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of\nthe pik and roll marketing strategy.\n    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under\nloan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference\nbetween the price he paid for certificates and the county loan\nrate.\n    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added\ncosts, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the\nprogram.\n    \"OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the\nmarket, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh\nthe added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is\ngood,\" an OMB official told Reuters.\n    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate\nworth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for\nwheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for\nsoybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit\nof about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.\n    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest\nthat an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to\nthe market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for\nevery dlr released in certificates.\n    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto\nthe market could cause prices to drop too low and government\ncosts to increase too much.\n    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of\ncertificates would be excessive.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "From April through December 1986,\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs\nworth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not\nbeen exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment said.\n    The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in\ncertificates has been authorized for issuance during\nJanuary-August, 1987.\n    These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn\nand wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department\nsaid in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.\n    Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain\nmore competitive on world markets, it said.\n    The department said last summer, for example, certificates\nwere exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped\nincrease marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices\naveraged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they\nwould have otherwise.\n    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40\nto 50 mln bushels, it said.\n    The department said government spending on farm programs in\nfiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from\n1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.\n    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half\nof the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,\nannual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last\nyear's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.\n    The department said the President's budget proposals for\n1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24\nbillion dlrs.\n    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain\nclose to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct\naverage of 1980-86, it said.\n    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume\nis expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven\nyears, the department said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "An Inland Revenue ruling accompanying\ntoday's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment\non certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a\n\"nightmare\" of practical application, banking sources said.\n    This is because banks will only be able to offset the tax\ncredit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they\nreceive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific\nloan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks\nprofits as a whole.\n    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a\nnightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.\n    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change\nare those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin\nAmerica. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were\ninvolved expect to suggest it was a \"sizable number.\"\n    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made\non or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest\narising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the\nmeasures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.\n    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of\nwithholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce\ninterest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue\nto the U.K. Treasury.\n    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the\nsubsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and\nbring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas\ncompetitors.\n    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the\nTreausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over\ntime from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.\n    But while compliance with the new measures could\nnecessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return\nto the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.\n    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans\ncontains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the\ntax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent\nthe loans would and could be changed.\n    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland\nRevenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these\nloans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a\nminimum.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In the first two\nmonths of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.\n    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus\ncaused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension\nof interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial\ndebt.\n    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new\nmeasures to correct the economy would be announced within a\nmonth, although he gave no further details.\n    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said \nBrazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to\nget additional assistance from commercial banks and others.\n    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the\nBrazilian cabinet.\n    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earlier\ntoday the government was considering a suggestion by the Chief\nof Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a new\nmulti-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's\ncurrent economic difficulties.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The National Association of Securities\nDealers said all stock exchanges should require that listed\ncompanies adopt a \"one-share, one-vote\" rule, but with a few\nexceptions.\n    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD\nPresident Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to be\nthe first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certain\nexceptions.\n    \"Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. If\na voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then\nthe commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,\"\nthe NASD said.\n    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the\nOTC offered only one class of stock.\n    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a\nuniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal\nvoting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.\n    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not\nhave voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled\nout to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from\nturning voting shares into non-voting shares, without\nshareholder approval, Parrillo said.\n    \"A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been\nconstrued by some to be an abusive practice involving the use\nof stock with other than full voting rights,\" the association\nsaid in the statement.\n    Exceptions would include:\n    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts\nconnected with the company's capital structure are clearly\nspelled out in the prospectus.\n    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition\nor recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied\nby detailed proxy material.\n    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of\nstock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority\nof independent directors on the board approve the move. The\nNYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual\nclasses to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.\n    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual\nclass shares where those with superior voting rights are not\nresalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect\nprevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

I don't pay attention to\nthe cost of living,\" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old\nCanadian teacher of English in Tokyo.\n    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by \"chatting\" 40\nhours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the\nlanguage. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet\ntwo-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of\nTokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has\nmanaged to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.\n    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating\nout once a day.\n    \"For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes\nwith soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso\nsoup, rice and tea,\" although she takes only coffee for\nbreakfast and a sandwich for dinner.\n    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents\nsee no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by\nforeign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.\n    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the\nprice to bring over the best people needed to back up their\npush into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.\n    \"You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and\ntrade down. It's not reasonable,\" said a spokesman for\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports\nWestern lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.\n    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business\ntravellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions\nAbroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on\naverage more than 300 dlrs a day.\n    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,\nmany tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to\nvisit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.\n    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates \"endaka\" caused an 11.5\npct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.\n    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by\ncurtailing shopping, it said.\n    To help combat \"endaka\" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist\nBureau prepared a pamphlet, \"Economical Travel in Japan.\"\n    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced\nbusiness hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public\nbaths while getting a \"revealing glimpse of Japanese in their\ndaily lives.\"\n    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's\nShin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.\n    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding\nEnglish teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,\nberth-sized twin-room in the Japanese \"flop house.\"\n    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for\nwork. \"Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll\nsplurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited\npizza for at least two hours.\"\n    Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. \"I had to\nspend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It said up to six mln dlrs went to Hojatoleslam\nHashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, and his\nfamily.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "More U.S. And European firms will be\nfalling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and\neager to extend their reach further overseas, according to\nmerger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.\n    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.\nBanks, steel and other businesses.\n    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> -- Japan's\nbiggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <Fairchild\nSemiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies\ncomponents for supercomputers.\n    Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co\nLtd <DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking\na niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the\ncountry's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas\nbanking, the takeover specialists said.\n    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating\nin the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all\nhave foreign businesses on their shopping lists.\n    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most\npressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto\nmakers they subcontract for as these move offshore.\n    \"The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up\npotential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --\nJapan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,\" a\ntakeover specialist at one trading company said.\n    Japanese companies have become among the world's richest\nafter a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed\nagainst the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.\n    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of\nJapan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into\nits traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,\nthe specialists said.\n    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more\nbarriers against Japanese exports.\n    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid\nthe gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.\nDomestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little\ninvestment opportunity.\n    \"Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but\nthe recent economic factors have become a driving force,\" said a\nbanking industry source.\n    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.\n    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in\nthe thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have\ntotalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.\n    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese\nacquisition activity was originally expected five years from\nnow, but that time span appeared now to be too long.\n    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.\n    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals\nInc's <DIAC.T> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.\nLast year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he\nadded.\n    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for\n550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid\nfor the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire\nbusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all\nbut its graphic arts-related businesses.\n    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon\nby the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese\npeople don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable\ndeals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese\ncompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is\na healthy progression.\"\n    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the\nboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.\n    \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a\nlarge U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will\nexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way for\nJapanese business.\"\n    A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many\nmega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big\ndeals there have already been done.\"\n    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of\nJapanese companies, the specialists said.\n    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in\nhigh-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology\nand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate\nfrom that trend,\" one takeover specialist said.\n    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If\nthese succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.\n    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait\nuntil the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading\nhouses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and\nforeign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as\ngo-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Some of them are producing less.\"\n    Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab\nEmirates, which had been generally been producing over its\nquota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still\npumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of\nthis year.\n    Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but\nan earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected\nits quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems\nmarketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.\n    OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by\n7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six\nmonths of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a\nbarrel from February 1.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The current\ngross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit\nand the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.\n    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about\n40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created\nproblems for many banks in managing their money effectively.\n    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly\nbecause of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.\nThe Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai\nbanking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion\nin bank deposits.\n    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have\nfurther buoyed the Thai stock market this week.\n    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday\nrecorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up\n4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.\n    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register\nmore gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.\n    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will\ngrow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for\nlocal banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of\nbank capital.\n    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry\ndate, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign\nexchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.\n    Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht\nof surplus funds to the local money market.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK>\nforecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in\nboth passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over\nthe year-earlier period.\n    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987\nbut said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747\nfreighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September\nand November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.\n    It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit\nto 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14\ncents a share.\n    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance\ncharges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.\n    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft\ndeliveries in 1986.\n    However, the company said in a statement good returns from\nfunds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher\ninterest costs resulting from additional lease financing and\nother borrowing.\n    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel\nprices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in\n1985.\n    Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last\nyear, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre\ntravelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But\npassenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.\n    The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in\ntotal tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in\nrevenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.\n    Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now\n50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by\nHongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by\n<China International Trust and Investment Corp>.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Global trading of yen bond futures is\njust around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon\non the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)\nand the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.\n    \"Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of\noverseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of\nglobal trading of yen bond futures,\" said Katsuyuki Okayasu,\ngeneral manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.\n    \"But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus\nfor the LIFFE yen bond futures market,\" said Tetsuya Dezuka,\ndeputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan\nSecurities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in\nLondon.\n    Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends\nbasically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets\noverseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,\ndealers said.\n    Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around\n140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.\n    An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on\nmutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond\nfutures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous\n12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was\nmade with yen bond futures trading in mind.\n    LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures\nafter receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last\nDecember.\n    But futures markets will never take root unless they are\nbacked by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers\nsaid.\n    Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now\nstand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-\nlinked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.\n    \"Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their\nfinancing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are\nengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,\"\nDezuka said.\n    The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese\nsecurities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And\nU.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's\ngrowth, dealers said.\n    Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be\npromoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this\nyear, securities managers said.\n    The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply\nto the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond\nfutures contract, they said.\n    The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading\nfutures of designated foreign government debt securities not\nlocated in the issuing country.\n    Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has\ndecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New\nYork as early as April.\n    CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of\nApril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura\nSecurities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still\nobstacles to trading on the London market.\n    \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are\nmajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said Koki\nChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's\nbond administration division.\n    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese\nsecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE\non these matters.\n    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with\ncoupon payment of either March and September, or June and\nDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months.\n    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and\nDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do not\nmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned\nby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities\nmanagers said.\n    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of\nbonds with matching months increases to over several billion\nyen, bond managers said.\n    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are\nexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low\ninterest rates, they said.\n    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to\nbe set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash\nissues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of\n1987.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A\nsimilar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a\nScandinavian borrower. Details were not immediately available.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Turner and Newall Plc said it planned to\nraise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of\n36.15 mln shares.\n    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's\nprice which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.\n    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,\nwhich had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a\nresult of the takeover of <AE Plc>.\n    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln\nstg from 39.6 mln previously.\n    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of\nsome 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings\nof some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end\nhad risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The\nrights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further\ndevelopment through investment and acquisition.\n    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after\na long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened\nthe group's position in the automotive components and\nengineering materials sectors.\n    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of\n27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months\npreviously.\n   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until\nDecember 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986\nresults.\n    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward\nto taking advantage of the opportunities available.\n   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from\nZimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local\ncurrency against the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000\nfrom 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from\n1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one\nmln due to lower exports to China.\n    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs\nsales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.\nOverseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three\nmonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.\n    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total\nproduction in 1990 from the present 20 pct.\n    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month\nperiod is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from\na year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.\n    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group\nnet profits and sales in the new financial year starting April\n1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net\nprofit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a\nyear earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Deutsche Babcock AG\n<DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a\ntwo-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal\ncapital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.\n    The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to\nApril eight, it added.\n    Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a\nclose of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged\nthree mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last\nweek that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.\nThese shares will be placed with institutional investors.\n    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,\nwhich share market analysts said was likely be used partly to\nfinance expansion, especially in environment technology.\n    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major\nFrankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to\nbring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered\nheavy losses in the early 1980s.\n    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these\nlosses, which were due to problems linked with three major\ncontracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net\nloss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.\n    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its\nresults in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose\nfrom the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.\n    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the\npricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was\nunfortunate.\n    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in\nVEBA AG <VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely\n2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with\na large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener\ninsurance group.\n    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has\ngenerally put pressure on West German stocks which have also\nsuffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.\n    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with\nIran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since\n1975.\n    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the\nmarket took the news calmly. Analysts said today the\ncombination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not\nhave a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct\nplacement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors\nboth in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Other partners should give\nup their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations.\"\n    EMS member Belgium has both a \"financial\" and a \"commercial\"\nfranc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct\nagainst other member currencies, compared with a permitted\nfluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.\n    According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the finance\nminister also urged greater convergence of economic and\nfinancial policies among European countries.\n    He added that monetary stability should be a priority for\nEuropean countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, he\nsaid it was wrong to presume that a \"permanent devaluation\" was\nthe answer to economic problems.\n    Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the\ndollar in 1985. \"But an overshooting in the other direction now\nbrings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And\nother countries whose currencies have declined,\" he added.\n    He said such a development could also produce further\nburdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement\nlast month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the\ndollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Talks are underway between financially\ntroubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed\nat rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\n    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a\ncompromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks\nenabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of\ncash.\n    For its part the government is expected to increase\nbudgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract\nforeign investors, the sources said.\n    \"Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled\nout in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial\npolitical and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors are\nbound to come to terms soon,\" a Western diplomat told Reuters.\n    \"The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF\nassistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's\nstrategic minerals fall into communist hands,\" the diplomat\nsaid.\n    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it\nwould limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to\n10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.\n    The government also announced an end to the floating\nexchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed\nparity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic\nadjustments.\n    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export\nrevenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the\ncopper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and\noften extravagant investment projects.\n    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth\nlargest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for\ntwo-thirds of its export earnings.\n    \"A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing\neverything for the sake of servicing its external debt,\"\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he\nannounced his government's decision.\n    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that \"one does\nnot feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one\ntoward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire,\" he\ntold diplomats.\n    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed\nausterity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital\nwithout receiving appropriate financing from abroad.\n    Economists said that since the large devaluation of the\nzaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net\noutflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.\n    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few\nyears reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross\nNational Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the\nworld, banking sources said.\n    Mobutu accused the IMF of \"strangling\" his country at an\nOctober meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people\ncould not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.\n    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the\nIMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,\nfailed to materialise last year,\n    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and\nboosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,\n    - substantial, additional financial help from the country's\ntraditional donors.\n    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at\ncurbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed\nspending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western\ncreditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.\n    As a result, the overall economic and financial situation\nimproved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from\n100 pct in 1983.\n    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living\nstandards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread\ndiscontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.\n    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between\n20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,\ndespite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced\nlast May.\n    The World Bank has released in the last two months half of\na previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent\n27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport\nsystem.\n    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading\npartner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to\nease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts\nfor industry.\n    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the\nway for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting\nof the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Traditionally, a provisional budget\ncovers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.\n    The government also expects the budget to meet pressure\nfrom trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic\ndemand, they said.\n    The budget includes expenditures for a program to create\n300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officials\nsaid.\n    They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary\ngeneral Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials\nyesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming\nas possible.\n    Economists said confidence of opposition members in their\ncampaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their\nsuccess in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could\nlead to even further delays in passing the full budget.\n    The result may be that the government will have to delay\nits planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in\nApril, economists said.\n    That package is expected to include a plan to carry out\nmore than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first\nhalf of the fiscal year, a government official said.\n    Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested\nNakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April\nbecause of the sales tax confrontation. Nakasone hopes to meet\nPresident Reagan to prepare for the economic summit of seven\nmajor industrial democracies in June, they added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\nsaid he was content with the current level of sterling and\nwelcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in\nBritish bank base lending rates to 10 pct.\n    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to\ndeclines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in\nfinancial markets might push for big moves quickly.\n    He told a briefing of economic journalists that \"I don't\nthink we should rush anything.\" Lawson stressed the themes of\n\"gradualism and steadiness\" as economic policy.\n    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates\nwere in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled\nyesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the\nkey Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of\nGDP.\n    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made\nthis month in the form of half percentage point declines, were\n\"perfectly consistent\" with monetary conditions now in Britain.\n    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply\naggregate was \"safely inside\" its flucuation band of two to six\npct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set\nno explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.\n    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the\nexchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),\nLawson repeated that \"it is most unlikely we will enter before\nthe next election.\"\n    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS\nmembership under constant review. But he would not indicate\nwhat the chief considerations for this were for the government.\n    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a\ndecision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of\nthe U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on\nother EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.\n    Although Lawson denounced what he said was \"the current wave\nof election fever\" in Britain, he added:  \"It is more likely that\nthere will be an election this year\" than not.\n    He said he supported an early election only because it\nwould clear the air. \"Ideally, we (the government) should have a\nfull term,\" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson\nsaid.\n    The government, which has been in power since 1979, must\ncall an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either\na June or an early autumn election, political sources said.\n    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88\n\"was the right balance, economically and politically,\" he said.\n    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate\nof tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted\nthat with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have\nallowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.\n    But it was being praised today by political analysts as a\nshrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not\nbe seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe\nthe electorate.\n    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much\nthe PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion\nstg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.\n    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson\nstressed that \"they are not an objective (for the government) -\nthey are an instrument of policy.\" Consequently the Treasury had\nno precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.\n    But \"there may be interest rate consequences\" from changes in\nthe level of government borrowing, he added.\n    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively\nhigh level of real interest rates had hurt investment in\nBritain.\n    He said conditions created by London's role as a leading\nfinancial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be\nhigher in real terms than in other countries.\n    Three factors had caused the higher level in relative\ninterest rates in Britain, Lawson said.\n    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest\nrates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.\n    He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused\nby proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.\n     Thirdly, he said \"we do not have as long a track record of\nlow inflation\" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.\n    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent\nfinancial centre, because it was more international in\ncharacter and more favourably placed in time zones than New\nYork or Tokyo.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Long-term\nrates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.\n    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and\nthe key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.\n    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the\nearly part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on\nthe Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a\nbasket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.\n    \"A marked improvement in the balance of payments is\nforecast,\" the NZIER said. \"The current account deficit is\nexpected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in\n1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.\"\n    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32\nbillion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and\n3.33 billion in 1985/86.\n    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion\ndlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87\nbillion in 1985/86.\n    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure\nof 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.\n    \"Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to\ncontribute to marked improvements in both the balance of\npayments and the rate of inflation ...,\" the NZIER said.\n    \"Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand\neconomy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well\nfor future prospects.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The latter two changes would make it harder for\nminority shareholders to elect directors.\n    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its\nshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.\n    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the\nvalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.\n    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire\n<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the\noffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the\nTax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private\nfor 1.66 billion dlrs.\n    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace\nas well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its\ntwo television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it\nfailed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign\npayments and political contributions.\n    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television\nstation WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los\nAngeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.\nAn investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would\nalso receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.\n    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs\non sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.\n    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and\nthe company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Bundesbank is likely to steer a\nsteady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in\ncredit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central\nbank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.\n    \"There is no need for action,\" Hermann Remsperger, chief\neconomist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.\n    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last\nmonth's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money\nstock growth is still well above the three to six pct target\nzone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.\n    One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank\nPresident Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf\ntwo weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only\nindicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.\n    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to\nfurther ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.\n    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to\nstimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade\ndeficit.\n    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also\nprecluded a further cut in official interest rates.\n    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5\npct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.\n    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank\ncouncil were worried about the continued overshoot in the money\nsupply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.\nBut Poehl played down the risk of inflation.\n    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained\nstable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to\nreturn to within the target range later this year.\n    \"The special factors which boosted money supply growth last\nyear are disappearing,\" one economist said.\n    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986\nwas caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.\n    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic\ncredit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock\ngrowth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.\n    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope\nfor a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.\n    Money market dealers said period rates remained little\nchanged, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.\n    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95\nyesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.\n    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on\nbehalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But\nrates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect\nof this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for\nthe federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.\n    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities\nrepurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in\nrates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned\nbanks.\n    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown\nthe Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.\n    One dealer said, \"If the central bank wanted lower interest\nrates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.\"\n    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve\nassets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on\nMonday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of\nMarch. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Itoh and\nCo.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while\nPacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. <MER.N> jointly\nhold 13 pct .\n    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several\nfirms including Toyota Motor Corp. <TOYO.T>  belong to both.\n    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger\nagreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the\ngovernment on having only one private consortium as two\ncompanies might invest \"excessive\" amounts.\n    He said talks with Cable & Wireless will continue this\nweek.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "West German commercial banks are\ncautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking\nsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the\nBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the\nusual interim period.\n    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting\nleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis\nby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>\nand Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank\nfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.\n    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to\ngauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings\nbanks.\n    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could\nreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to\ndraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one\neconomist at the German Banking Association said.\n    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially\nundercut by lower savings rates because many customers are\nparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest\nthem at higher yields in the future, he said.\n    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more\nfunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated\nsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money\nsupply aggregate.\n    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5\npct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,\nunchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the\nexpanded target range of three to six pct.\n    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private\ncustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers are\nbeginning to decline.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "(General Partners), a Texas general\npartnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and\nAFG Industries Inc <AFG>, said it currently holds 2,180,608\ncommon shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's <GY>\noutstanding common stock.\n    General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash\ntender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,\nthat is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.\n    Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,\naerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares\noutstanding.\n    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of\nfinancing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.\n    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.\nWilliam Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it\nwas willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to\nmeet as soon as possible.\n    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed\n250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for \na one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and\na 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,\na unit of American Express Co <AXP>.\n    A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was\nmeeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He\nsaid he was not sure the company had formally received notice\nof the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.\n    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or\nwhether it would issue a statement later today.\n    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain\nGencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the\ncompany's plastics and industrial products businesses and its\ntires and related products segment.\n    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General\nbroadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes\nover license renewals at several of its television stations.\nGencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR\nin the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.\n    General Partners officials were not immediately available.\n    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York\nStock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE\nsaid the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The\nshares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.\n    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in\nequity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from\nShearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for\nwhich a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours\nafter a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr\ncredit line from Wells Fargo.\n    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the\nline itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,\nthe partnership said.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in\nthe tender offer, it said.\n    In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it\ncould obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.\n    Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered\nto acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but\nwithdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler\neventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "<Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its\n1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of\ndepreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> shares\nand because of securities trading losses in the U.S.\n    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's\nseven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on\nits risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some\neight mln stg to 82.2 mln.\n    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal\napproaches about a takeover of the group but was not\ninterested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not\nelaborate.\n    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during\nthe brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc\n<DIST.L> in the first half of last year.\n    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the\naffairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused\non the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the\nTakeover Code by prompting others to support its share price\nduring the bid.\n    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of\ncorporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance\ndirector Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness\naffair.\n    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,\nresigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider\ninformation. He currently faces criminal charges.\n    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the\nmost traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had\nbeen supportive.\n    \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have\nthe worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\"\n    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits\nof 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from\ncorporate finance activities and progress in asset management.\n    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the\nperformance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable\ntouch of the budget.\"\n    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new\nchief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as\ninterim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a\nnew chief executive within a few months.\n    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of\n562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but\ndeclined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going\non to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.\n    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on\nyesterday's 375p.\n REUTER...\n\u0003",

You\nare jumping off the edge into the unknown.\"\n    Bosworth, who retires on April 2 after almost four years as\nU.S. Ambassador, forecast a real per capita increase in\ndisposable income of more than four pct in 1987.\n    The Philippines has not seen such an increase this decade.\n    He said there were reasons to believe the Philippines could\nout-perform the world economy by enough to continue to generate\nincreases in per capita income in the medium term.\n    \"There is nothing big and dramatic yet and maybe big and\ndramatic won't ever happen. But I think foreign investors are\nnow no longer saying let's wait and see how the political side\nturns out,\" he said.\n    Bosworth said much hope had been placed on the land reform\nprogram promised by President Corazon Aquino, but he warned it\nwas not a complete cure for the country's ills.\n    He said even the redistribution of land to tenant farmers\nwould not be a substitute for the generation of new employment\nin the countryside.\"There is no way even in 1987 that this\ncountry can provide employment growth in farming. Certainly it\nis not going to be able to do so in the future,\" he added.\n    \"This has to be off-farm employment,\" he declared.\n    Bosworth said the population problem produced major\nuncertainties for the future of the country. He said that more\nthan 60 pct of today's 50 mln people are said to live below the\npoverty line and official predictions suggest the population\nwill double within the next three decades.\n    The ambassador said he believed population statistics to be\nunderstated.\n    Bosworth said he expected current high domestic liquidity\nto be drawn down during the next six months with some\ncorresponding upward pressure on interest rates, now at about\nnine pct.\n    He said his predictions only assumed the Aquino government\ndid not make any big mistakes. They did not assume any great\ntransformation of the Philippine system.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Audi had predicted last\nyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified\namount from 1985's record levels.\n    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from\n9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10\nbillion this year.\n    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the\nparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi\nwould ensure VW got a share of profits.\n    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free\nreserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years\nVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.\n    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output\ncaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on\ncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About\nalleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.\n    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct\nto 59,800 last year.\n    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom\nout in 1987.\n    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.\n    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,\nbut domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180\nin 1985.\n    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the\nfirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall\nmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the\nsame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales\nfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide\ndeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to\n57,000.\n    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to\nover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen\ncompared with 1985's 392,000.\n    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to\nfurther new hiring of employees.\n    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record\n39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Most of the cattle now being placed on\nU.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on\nfeed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle\nprices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.\n    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a\nlonger time blunted the market impact of the high placements\nreported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock\nanalysts said.\n    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in\nseven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had\nexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a\n15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.\n    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted\nreports that many cattle put on feed were relatively\nlightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter\ncattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the\nsummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally\nplaced on feed.\n    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to\nobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge\nthat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.\n    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,\nhelps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from\nFebruary, 1986.\n    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes\nsaid, \"The probabilities are high that in order to place that\nmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to\nlighter-weight cattle.\n    The only statistics available are from some terminal\nmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the total\ncattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs\nin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.\n    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,\nGrimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.\n    If the average weight is down, and there is no price\nweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at\nlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as\nthree pct.\n    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly\nLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly\nbecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle\nprices.\n    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain\nsupplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle\nprices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from\nwheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.\n    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat\npasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.\n    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and\nGraham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend\nis to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his\narea benefited from a dry, mild winter.\n    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and\nsome cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less\nthan normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

A smaller group of\nrepresentatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.\n    \"Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it\nany stronger than that,\" Ward said.\n    \"It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...\nbut one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate,\" said\nanother trader of today's developments.\n    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations\nand have remained so, traders said.\n    \"The dealers have got historically small positions in\noutright terms,\" one trader said.\n    Speculators have gone net long \"but only slightly so,\" he\nadded.\n    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the\nlast two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally\nagainst the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure\nof origin selling, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This should cut the global oversupply to 850\ntonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.\n    The study noted that the effects of last year's lower\nprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which\nwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago.\n    However, the study said that primary production, likely to\nreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in\n1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.\n    Around a third of silver production comes from heavily\nindebted Mexico and Peru.\n    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the\nmajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.\nBank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's\ndetermination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but\nfinancial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.\n    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2\npct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed\na further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.\n    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates\nafter yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg\nreduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion\nstg.\n    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key\nthree-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start\nof business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied\nto four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.\n    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with\ngains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper\nbelow nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.\n    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have\nplacated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates\nrecovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling\nand gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.\n    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and\nthe reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors\nwas set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt\nprices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.\n    \"Today's cut was slightly disappointing,\" said Bill Martin,\nchief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. \"The\nBank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper\nthe markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.\"\n    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash\nto U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to\nmaintain the new rates for about that period of time.\n    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how\nsterling performs in the near term.\n    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially\nthrough Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains\nwould force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.\n    \"The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the\ntime being,\" said Midland Bank treasury economist David\nSimmonds. \"But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold\nup rates for long.\"\n    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents\nthis week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.\n    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan\nSecurities, said \"There is another half point to come in the\nnear term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a\nwhole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.\"\n    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had\nvery little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange\nrate.\n    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of\na sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not\nmaterialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact\non manufactured exports would show almost immediately.\n    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well\nas cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances\nof re-election for the Conservative government and probably\nadvanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.\nCombined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this\nwas likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated\nassets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial\ntargets.\n    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour\nbecause of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's\nMarshall said \"Sterling is simply the best game in town,\nespecially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry\nplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of\nrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts\nand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.\n    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored\nrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the\nmarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea\nthrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.\n    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct\nmore competitive than Japan's due to such factors.\n    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of\ncurrent capacity within two years through mergers and\nregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month\nand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.\n    They said from September a semi-government body will assure\nrepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred\nthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another\n30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.\n    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied\nto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage\nbuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.\n    The commission has held several hearings with the industry\nand approval should be given this month, the sources said.\n    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a\nplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support\nshould help Japanese yards recover their international\ncompetitiveness, they said.\n    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of\nbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a\nmaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)\nin 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.\n    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most\nyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.\n    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for\n1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to\n3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.\n    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to\n30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between\n1986 and 1989.\n    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,\nfollowed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's\nRegister of Shipping.\n    However, falling orders and declining international\ncompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in\nthe industry, the sources said.\n    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding\ncompanies reported current deficits in the first half of the\nyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to report\ncurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.\n    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise\nproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also\nbeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt\nyears, the sources said.\n    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in\nfierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The\ntwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T>\nand Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> --\naccount for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.\n    \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out\nthe recession as their technology is the best in the world,\"\nsaid an official at a major Japanese shipping company.\n    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,\nhas no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,\nand this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The vaccine consists of\nsmallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS\nvirus.\n    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would\nallow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would\nhave to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing\ntwo AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid\nvirus is created that simulataneously immunizes against\nsmallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.\n    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the\nAIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins\nand it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity\nagainst AIDS.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

FECSA faces repayment of 60 billion\npesetas in interest and 30 billion on principal this year.\n    The U.S. Bank spokesman said foreign banks \"were now more in\nthe dark\" than ever.\n    FECSA called for renegotiating its debt when the Madrid\nstock exchange on February 6 suspended trading in its shares, a\nmove which officials said was meant to protect shareholders.\n    Zaforteza said the company will ask its creditors to switch\nold debt to new loans at lower interest rates, postpone\ninterest payments and possibly convert some debt into shares.\n    Foreign bankers said they assumed the government was\ninvolved in the control and management of the electricity\nsector.\n    They added that lending policy toward the industry could be\naffected if the banks lost money in FECSA.\n    Foreign banking sources said they considered likely a fresh\npostponement of a 10 billion peseta Chase Manhattan Bank\n<CMB.N> led syndicated loan to power company <Hidrolectrica de\nCataluna S.A.> (Hidruna).\n    The facility was scheduled to be signed in mid-February but\nwas postponed when the bourse suspended FECSA's shares.\n    \"We planned to sign this month but that looks unlikely under\nthe present circumstances,\" a foreign banker said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

No amounts were disclosed.\n    Continental said it decided to deal with this change \"in\nits entirety\" in 1987.\n    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation\nrules, and although the impact will not be material in the\nshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, that\nincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report\nsaid.\n    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by\n17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.\n    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8\nmln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in\n1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it\nsaid.\n    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the\nuse of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental\ntakes place, the report said.\n    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\nsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next\ntwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.\n    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior\nconvertible preference stock in Continental to the public in\nthe form of common stock.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the\nSoviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing\nthe price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf\nexport point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.\n    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the\ncash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a\ndealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than\nnormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making\nit worthwhile for farmers to move grain.\n    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA\ncould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,\nwhere PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the\ngovernment price support loan program and then marketed.\n    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement\nwould break the Gulf corn basis.\n    \"The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county\nposted prices,\" one dealer said. \"It should be taking the\naverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,\" which\nwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior\nMidwest.\n    \"But we don't know when they might do it,\" an Ohio dealer\nsaid, which has created uncertainty in the market.\n    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort\nto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to\nthe government and remain off the market and in storage.\n    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly\nmore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates\nit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date\nbeen exchanged for grain.\n    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK\ncertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the\nUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain\nby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.\n    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in\nbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest\nto the export terminals, cash dealers said.\n    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen\nnearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the\noriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of\nthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the\nfirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.\n    The higher transportation costs have served to depress\ninterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by\nthe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as\ndiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.\n    \"The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,\"\nwhich indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much\nas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader\nsaid.\n    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,\nfreight rates will settle back down because of the overall\nsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The DIW economic research institute\nsaid West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach\nthe 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.\n    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than\nthose of the other four leading German institutes, said the\neconomy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its\nprospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.\n    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national\nproduct (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in\nreal, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter\nof last year. \n    The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the\nremaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and\nproduction would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to\n1.5 pct.\n    Other institutes and economists have recently revised their\nforecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.\n    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that\nthe economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand\nhealthy but foreign demand weak.\n    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for\ncapital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer\ngoods, not between foreign and domestic demand.\n    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been\nhit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had\ncaused West German firms to scale back investment plans.\n    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were\ncontinuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,\nit said.\n    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute\nin Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall\nmarkedly this year.\n    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change\nfrom 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further\nimprovement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared\nwith 1986, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The government announced a three billion\nfranc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation\namong political and economic analysts that it is positioning\nitself for a period of economic reflation.\n    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister\nJacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe\nSeguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc\ncontingency fund announced on February 25.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a\nreflationary program.\n    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for\nmore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third\nof French unemployed, government figures show.\n    The main measures of the employment program give employers\nfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at\nleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-term\nunemployed return to the labour market.\n    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security\ncontributions are the main incentives for employers.\n    \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong\nincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour\nmarket and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to\nSeguin said.\n    The analysts said speculation the government is considering\na reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis\nBaudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally\nagreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.\n    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out\neconomic stimulation despite the government's revision of its\n1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.\n    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's\nremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate\nthe economy through a boost to consumer spending although\ngovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investment\nfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.\n    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue\nfrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt\nand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.\n    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly\nreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on\nsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.\n     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of\nstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and\ndrove the government into a new mood of conciliation with\nlabour.\n     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation\nof Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas\n<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year\nprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it\nthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in\n1988.\n    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted\nrevenue to boost industrial and research investment and\nspending on infrastructure such as the national motorway\nnetwork.\n   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last\nyear by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage\nmore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by\nimproving the competitiveness of French industry.\n    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and\nvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put\nto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed\nfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of\nState.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil\nand natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan\nAdministration for consideration.\n    \"These options boost production, while avoiding the huge\ncosts associated with proposals like an oil import fee,\"\nHerrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. \"It is my\nintention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy\ncouncil and the cabinet for consideration and review.\"\n    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil\ndepletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,\nshould be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at\nthe least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.\n    \"The goal of the Administration policies is to increase\ndomestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels\na year.\"\n    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday\nwarning the United States was threatened by a growing\ndependence on oil imports.\n    \"We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65\npct by 1995,\" Herrington said.\n    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration\npolicy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would\nbe opposition to tax changes.\n    \"Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options\nwould require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the\ntax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been\nfavored by the administration. I think what we need is to\ndebate this within the Administration,\" he said.\n    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.\n    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's\nWashington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging\nan increase in the oil depletion allowance.\n    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington\nsaid various proposals were under consideration and would be\ndebated within the Administration to determine which would have\nthe most benefits at the least cost.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Hopes that\nforeign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr\nbudget deficit have been dashed, they added.\n    Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's\ngovernment would shortly announce a four-year economic plan\naimed at starting the country's recovery.\n    Details of the plan have not been made public. But the\nsources said it would be geared to generate agricultural\nexports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans\nthat Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

His\noffice understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.\n    A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters that\nSchmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United States\nbut had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were not\nknown.\n    Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currency\nand money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banks\nand other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.\n    The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the state\nprosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came to\nlight on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidence\nof personal enrichment by VW employees.\n    The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW had\nincurred losses in the \"three-figure millions\" because it had not\nprotected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.\n    This was denied at the time by VW executive board chairman\nCarl Hahn.\n    Financial director Rolf Selowsky resigned last week after\nnews of the currency fraud, an executive has been fired and\nseveral others are suspended.\n    A Frankfurt business lawyer, Egon Geis, said yesterday that\non February 10 he had offered VW information about the currency\nfraud and offered to provide a written confession by someone\ninvolved.\n    He said VW declined his offer, but the company says the tip\nwas taken to top management and that Geis later met Hahn but\nfailed to produce the document.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling\nlast year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas\nbubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next\nwinter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that\nis difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could\nmore than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by\n1990, some analysts said.\n    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities\nand big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of\nactivity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of\nthe nation's largest gas reserves are located.\n    \"We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,\" said\nJames Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Many\ncompanies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling\nbecause they're betting that the gas market will be back in\nbalance in a year or two.\"\n    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news\nfor drilling and oilfield service companies that barely\nsurvived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a\nbarrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a\nreturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig\ncount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield\nroustabouts commanded premium wages.\n    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, a\nbarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs\nactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.\n    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but\ndived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil\nprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.\n    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United\nStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that\nreplacement rate won't be any better this year.\"\n    He added, \"We don't have the options we do with oil.\nImports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and\nimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible\nin the next 10 years because of the cost.\"\n    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves\nwere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16\ntrillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.\n    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co\nagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a\nnew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.\n    \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to\ndedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990\nsupplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later\nthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said.\n    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\ncould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\nto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\n    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\nconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\nfederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\ngovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or three\nyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\nCorp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\nalready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\nthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\n    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, will\nspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\nproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\ngas per day.\n    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\nKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in\nrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\non the verge of a recovery.\n    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\n600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\n    \"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\nabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\nexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\n    Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\nis skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\n    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\nsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\nwhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\nseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\ndlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\ndlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Latin American sugar producers\nare awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving\nto boost production, official and trade sources said.\n    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.\nCents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the\nregion's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.\n    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the\nalert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),\ntold Reuters.\n    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven\ncents to stimulate notable increases in output.\n    \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their\nproduction when the prices are profitable,\" he said.\n    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued\nrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders\nin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.\n    \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice\npresident of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural\nLeague. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider\nincreasing production.\"\n    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing\noutput, given the instability of world markets.\n    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar\nCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.\n\"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet\ngiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify\nanything.\"\n    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are\navailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln\ntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A\nyear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000\nmore, according to the London-based International Sugar\nOrganization.\n    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar\nindustry in many countries in the region into a recession from\nwhich it will be hard to recover.\n    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's\nNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost\nproduction even if prices recovered sharply.\n    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from\n900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport\nand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short\nterm recovery in output, he added.\n    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar\nexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end\nof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is\nrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.\n    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems\nand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,\nsince much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries\nunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its\ntroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in\n1985.\n    The low world prices of recent years have led many\ncountries in the region to cut exportable production to levels\nwhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean\ncountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which\nthey receive prices well above free market levels.\n    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to\nproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to\nthe free world market.\n    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In\nboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year\nits quota is only 37,000.\n    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world\nmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's production\ncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.\n    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials\nstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane\nwhich, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo\nLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.\n    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240\nmln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in\nexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into\nsugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.\n    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol\nInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from\nforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.\n    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the\npast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant\nBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in\n1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to\nnext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point\nbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of\nsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would\ncost eight cents to replace.\n    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export\nsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with\nthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of\neither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild\ndepleted reserve stockpiles.\n    However, the situation could change dramatically if the\neconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.\n    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little\nhope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability\nunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.\n    \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of\nthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harm\nby closing their markets, by price deterioration in\ninternational commerce and furthermore by the unfair\ncompetition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry\nMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA\nmeeting.\n    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for\nwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excess\noutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the\nmain cause of low prices.\n    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which\nwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the\nregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement\nwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised\ncountries would have to see it as a political rather than a\nmerely economic pact.\n    \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,\nthe less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the\nregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender\noffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be\nenough to buy the company, analysts said.\n    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General\nPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of\nGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty\nsurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to\nGencorp broadcasting licenses.\n    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.\n    \"The expectation is either there will be someone else or\nthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's\ncooperation,\" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton\ngroup.\n    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to\nGencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio\nstations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,\nwere brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments\nand political contributions.\n    \"I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,\"\nsaid Baker of the offer.\n    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue\nmight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time\nfor any transaction.\n    A source close to General Partners, however, said General\nPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission\nfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.\nThe source said if approved, the authority would allow a\ntransaction to be carried out.\n    If it received the \"short-form\" approval, General Partners\nwould set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting\nproperties until the licensing situation is resolved.\n    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and\nBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.\n    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as\nGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of\nthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell\nthe stations.\n    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt\nDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.\nDisney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a\ngroup that challenged the station's license.\n    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in\nSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.\n    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's\nplastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and\nrelated products segment.\n    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said\nthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as\nmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace\nbusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion\ndlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,\nincluding assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per\nshare, he said.\n    The company, formerly known as General Tire\nand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be\nworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling\nbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, he\nsaid.\n    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who\nbecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's\nAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,\nfounded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the\nyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.\n    \"The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal\nwith the non-strategic assets of the company,\" Rose said.\n    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but\nthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.\nThey said it would be possible the company might consider a\nleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.\n    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there\nwas some concern about \"greenmail.\" Greenmail is the payment at\na premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.\n    \"I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing\nsurprises me anymore,\" said Rose.\n    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained\nFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

There are\nabout 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.\n    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one\n1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's\ninterstate banking law takes effect.\n    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island\nbased bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln\ndlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.\nholding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and\nassets of 11.1 billion dlrs.\n     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the\ntransaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar\nearnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that\ncash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline\nfor either company's stock holders, the company said.\n    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash\ndividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual\ndistibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68\ndlrs a share.\n    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other\nan option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued\nshares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the\nfully diluted shares outstanding.\n    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and\nshareholder approval.\n    The companies said that after the proposed merger, the\ncombined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the\ncountry.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Continental Illinois Corp's <CIL>\nChairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to\nreschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six\nmonths.\n    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of\ninterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is\nexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks\nare under way.\n    \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,\nfor an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's\ndebt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.\n    \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just\nhow long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said.\n    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium\nmay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs\nand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.\n    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these\nloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the\nContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,\nContinental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an\ninquiry.\n    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net\nincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.\n    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for\n1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.\nContinental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing\noffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.\n    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a\nshare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.\n    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and\nother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,\nduring 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the\n1984 restructuring agreement with the government.\n    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it\nis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,\nSwearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss\nrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.\n    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market\nrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.\n    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank\nwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it\nbought three small suburban banks.\n    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be\ntaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large\nenough to buy it, and New York money center banks are\nprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.\n    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who\nwill eventually own the firm because it still holds the\nequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.\n    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has\nsaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The\nagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984\nbailout of the bank.\n    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the\nstruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry\nexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period he\nagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not\ncomment on a successor.\n    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options\nclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its\ndoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country\ndoesn't need external sources of cash.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They cannot be imposed by the United States\nalone on the world trading system,\" he said.\n    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state\nlegislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb\nimports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two\nyears ago but vetoed by President Reagan.\n    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the\nentire trade bill because of the textile amendment.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The 1988 agriculture budget will\nhave to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the\nchairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.\n    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the\nuse of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are\npossibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,\nsaid Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture\nsubcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.\n    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and\nFeed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the\nHouse budget committee that the agriculture committee will have\nto reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion\ndlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.\n    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be\nmade very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988\nbudget, Glickman added.\n    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's \nproposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.\n    \"The administration's target price proposals are dead in\nthe water,\" he said.\n    To cut the budget, Glickman said, \"everthing is on the\ntable,\" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.\n    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee\nwill study in order to cut farm spending.\n    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and\n1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he\nsaid would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.\n    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or \"pik')\ncertificates will also be another option his committee will\nstudy, Glickman said.\n    While not committing himself for or against such action, he\nsaid lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which\nindicate certificates cost more than cash payments.\n    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and\ntightening up of the person definition for annual payment\nlimitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.\n    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by\nfive pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move\nthat could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would\nnot be in favor of such a change.\n    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,\nEEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being\nused up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand\nthis program while making cuts in other areas.\n    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.\n    \"I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping\nblock,\" Glickman said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Prices have since steadied to\naround 18 dlrs a barrel.\n     At the same time, a number of company executives testified\nthat the nation's domestic exploration and production segment\nwas still hurting and in need of government help.\n     Production costs are considerably higher in the United\nStates than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell\nmany domestic producers were forced to shut down their\noperations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs\noperating in the United States compared with an average of\nnearly 2,000 in 1985.\n     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of\nEnergy, many said the falling production of domestic oil\ncoupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing\ndependency on imports, particularly from the politically\nvolatile Middle East.\n     \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower\nprices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day\n(bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply\nDepartment at Exxon Corp <XON>, the nation's largest oil\ncompany.\n     At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined\nby 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net\npetroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\"\n     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain\nbetween 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to\ncontrol production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at\n1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare\nworldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\"\n     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued\nvolatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies\nin support of the domestic petroleum industry.\"\n     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal\ngovernment through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\"\nlegislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall\nprofits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access\nto federal lands for oil and gas exploration.\n     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the\nindustry have called for as a way of building up the nation's\ndomestic operations before imports reach such a level that\nnational security might be compromised.\n     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports\ncould make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that\nPersian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the\nfree world's total oil consumption by that date.\n     Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on\nearth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of <Pitts Oil Co>, today called\nfor a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before\nthe treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and\nour national security is compromised.\"\n     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,\nagreed, saying that like many federal government programs that\nwere set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a\n\"shambles.\"\n     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.\n\"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is\nover,\" he said.\n     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining\nand Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\"\nadding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by\nmidyear.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Carolina Power and Light Co said\nits board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the\nsecond unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.\n    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about\none pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in\n1992.\n    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under\nreview because of a decision by the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission that would have required\nthe unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing\nscrubbers.\n    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation\nsince 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers\nthrough the use of low-sulphur coal, and \"The addition of\nscrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal\nair quality improvements.\"\n    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost\npower from Duke Power Co <DUK> for intermediate and peaking\npurposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with\nscrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later\ndevelopment of a generating unit.\n    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about\n877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  \"The\nhigher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would\nincrease the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with\nscrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.\"\n    A company spokesman said the company has already spent\nabout 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been\nmade of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does\nnot expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina\nPower intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings\nit will make late this year or early next year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Its Granite State Electric unit\nplans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year\nas well.\n    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares\nthis year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise\nabout 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its\ndividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.\n    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the\nconstruction spending projection is based on the expectation\nthat demand for electricity in the New England electric system\nwill grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.\n    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for\nsharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2\npct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.\n    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices\nand a strong New England economy.\n    Huntington said New England Elecetric has \"all but rejected\nnew coal fired plants\" to supply additional power.\n    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those\nwith short lead times which can be built in modules.\n    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is\nlooking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply\nmost of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired\nfluidized bed units.\n    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in\nmodular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the\ntraditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said\nearnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase\nby \"substantially more\" than the 30 pct average annual growth\nexperienced in the last four years.\n    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2\nbillion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit\nacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw\npresident Michael de Groote told analysts.\n    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,\nor 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.\n    De Groote also said the company expects \"excellent results\"\nin the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more\nspecific.\n    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not\ninclude possible further acquisitions and said that the\naddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988\nthrough fiscal 1990.\n    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four\nquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The\nrest came from acquisitions, he said.\n    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,\na subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will\nnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.\n    He also said he is \"not very optimistic\" about the ongoing\nnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based\nchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and\nU.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.\n    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the\nproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the\nnext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical\nwaste business through GSX Corp.\n    \"We feel it is a profitable business with good growth\npotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right\nmanagement,\" de Groote said.\n    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.\nsubsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a\n200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.\n    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in\ncash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.\n    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will\nrepresent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will\ncontribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.\n    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing\nwell and there are no plans to sell it, he said.\n    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to\nearnings per share for the year. He also said that further\nacquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely\nwithin the next few months.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Interstate Commerce Commission\n(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,\nconcluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroads\nhad adequate revenues in 1985.\n    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely\nto look favorably on requests for rate increases by these\nrailroads made during the current year.\n    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to\nrate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.\n    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by\nthe government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate\nif it finds it to be unreasonable.\n    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC\nhas been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry\nand shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of\nfive commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.\n    \"For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns\nhave fallen well short of their cost of capital, however\ndefined,\" commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted\nwith the majority.\n    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the\nhighest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and\nOhio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3\npct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and\nthe Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.\n    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the\nDelaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the\nWestern Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

GenCorp today\nreceived a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8\npct of its stock.\n    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp\nstock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.\n    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was\nreported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive\ninvestors to show holdings of more than five pct.\n    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown\nand AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender\noffer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and\n20 dlrs per share too low.\n    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.\n    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider\nspinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast\nproperties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast\nproperties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.\n    \"One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to\nthe meeting and putting up \"no greenmail,\" Gabelli said.\n    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation\nin the offer.\n    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Foreign\ncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of\nbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.\n    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business\nchiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is\neffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped\nsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.\n    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from\nthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said\nthat it came close to one mln stg.\n    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct\nto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed\n8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.\n    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to\nlower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.\nWagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leaders of the major U.S.\ncommodity exchanges and their federal regulators begin a\nthree-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry's\ngrowth but uncertain about their futures.\n    An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected to\nattend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures Industry\nAssociation, FIA.\n    The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of the\nU.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.\n    The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stems\nlargely from a pervasive sense that the potential for major\nmarket disruption stalks the futures, options and equity\nindustries.\n    This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as the\nfinancial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter's\ntriple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threaten\nto rock markets.\n    Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and options\nand individual stock options expire simultaneously.\n    The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by price\nvolatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments between\nstocks and their derivative instruments.\n    In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500\nstock index futures contract, recently announced plans to move\nthe contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterly\nexpiration day from the afternoon.\n    The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends to\nimplement stricter procedures requiring members to submit all\nmarket-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.\n    Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contract\nexpirations, there is a sense more might have to be done to\navert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.\n    Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats of\nfortified federal regulation and congressional action to strap\nmarket activity.\n    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Susan\nPhillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequate\nto cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects new\nsurveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, SEC.\n    SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over price\nvolatility associated with program trading, has resurrected a\nproposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulators\ncontrol over the setting of futures margins.\n    Some contend that because futures margins are low relative\nto stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shift\nout of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hastening\na downward price spiral.\n    Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressional\nplayer -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House\nEnergy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee\nresponsible for overseeing the SEC.\n    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and\nexplore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market\ndisruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual\ntrading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for\ntheir own account before placing customers' orders.\n    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the\nperception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the\npractice. The CME board responded with a plan that would\nrestrict, but not ban, the activity.\n    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from\nAustralia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and\nSingapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC\nproposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign\nfutures and options on U.S. exchanges.\n    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the\ngrounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.\n    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the\nexchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement\nstrict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to\nrevise federal limits on speculative positions and the\ndefinition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new\ninstruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr\nacquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit has\ndramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,\nlargely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company\nofficials and analysts said.\n    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second\nlargest overnight courier business just two months after\nanother Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the\nacquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New\nJersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>.\n    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by\nfinancial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies\nand likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out\nforeign owned courier operations.\n    \"It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at\nthe right time,\" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst\nTony Hine commented.\n    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.\ncompanies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off\ntheir Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt\nThomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.\n    \"There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent\nselling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being\nunder siege or taking someone else over,\" he said.\n    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd\nas part of its previously announced program to sell off four\noperating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco\nExpress marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.\n    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,\nand proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of\ndebt by year-end, the company said.\n    While company officials declined to disclose earnings and\nrevenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant\nposition in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a\nday and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs\na year.\n    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit\nformed an important part of a company restructuring program,\nadopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>,\nacquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would\nconsider acquiring the whole company.\n    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company\nformed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of\nPurolator's U.S. courier business.\n    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier\nbusiness represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a\nmarket it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman\nEsther Szynkarsky said.\n    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in\nEMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.\n    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said\nthe two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and\nthe two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.\n    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of\nseeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline\nbusiness.\n    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,\nindependently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already\noperates its own air cargo business that includes a small\ndoor-to-door courier operation.\n    \"They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing\nwell in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep\nit,\" Szynkarsky said.\n    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units\nwill likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery\nnetwork, generating traffic for the former parent companies\nwithout them having to tie up capital in Canada.\n    \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is\nincremental revenue,\" Hine said.\n    \"It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in\nplace the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff\nthrough, the more money you make,\" he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But it had indicated that consideration would be given\nin due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by\nAmalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.\n    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance\nof permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry\nfears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of\nreview and change, the press release said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said it\nhas sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to\nprovide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the\nU.S. money markets.\n    The investment banker said its variable money market\ncertificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating\nrate CDs, with the rate based on the AA commercial paper\ncomposite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n    Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly\ninstitutional investors. The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and\nwas oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.\n    The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were\nSanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi\nKangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each with\ntranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.\n    The investment banking firm said another series of variable\nmoney market CDs is planned for April.\n    \"The variable money market CDs provide a low cost\ndependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks,\" said\nRobert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman\nCommercial Paper Inc. \"The instrument enables banks to\ndiversify their funding base in a significant way.\"\n    In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were\nset at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which\nis expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis\npoints, Shearson said.\n    The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be\nsubject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York\nFed's commercial paper composite rate.\n    Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the\ncommercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be\ndetermined by investor demand. It added that other Japanese\nbanks may participate in future issues.\n    \"For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not\nonly to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper\ninvestors at rates which are competitive with traditional\nfloating rate CDs,\" said Michael Balaban, a vice president with\nShearson's commercial paper unit.\n    He added, \"For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractive\nbecause they are domestically issued paper with competitive\nrates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks.\"\n    Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money\nmarket funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank\npaper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said, \"The government's policy is\nto sell its minority holdings in companies as and when\ncircumstances permit.\n    \"As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,\nsubject to market conditions, the government will sell its\nremaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year.\"\n    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in\nSeptember 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln\nordinary shares in the company.\n    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers\nfor the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in\nbeing considered for this would be interviewed in early April.\n    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares\nin an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price\nthen was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a\nTreasury spokesman said.\n    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the\ngovernment's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or\nMay, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority\nwhich is slated for privatisation in either June or July.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Congress and the oil industry\nare deeply divided on ways the government should assist the\nindustry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the\nsubsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.\n    \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support an\noil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\"\nsaid Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research\nAssociates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.\nCongress on energy issues.\n    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax\nincentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.\n    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will\npropose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural\ngas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for\nconsideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the\nproposal would be reviewed.\n    Herrington said, \"I would like to shoot for one mln barrels\na day (addition) to U.S. production.\" U.S. oil output was off to\n8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last\nyear, the American Petroleum Institute said.\n    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average\nabout 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a\nmove above that level will be unlikey for the near term.\n    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that\n\"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've\nonly altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for\nthe year.\"\n    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and\nexploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output\nwill not take place as the companies are waiting for stable\nprices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.\n    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry\nResearch Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to\nCongress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is\nvirtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But\nthe future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil\nprices and U.S. government policy.\"\n    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil\nproduction but would only work over time.\n    \"Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably\nbe a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but\nwould not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said.\n    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the\ndrilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief\nwhich could be brought on by an oil import fee.\n    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International\nAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of our\ntrade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil\nimport fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our\nnation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil\nservice companies.\n    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee\nwill face a stiff uphill battle.\n    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by\na former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil\nimport fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a\nmeans of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.\n     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed\nopposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would\nhurt consumers and some regional interests.\n    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow\nif production continued to fall and imports to rise.\n    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements\n\"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above\nthat level, a fee may not be legislated but there will\ncertainly be pressure for some form of action.\"\n     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, \"a 50 pct\nrate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.\n    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy\nrequirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Argentine grain growers reduced\ntheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the current\nharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.\n    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach\nbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes\nestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in\nmid-February.\n    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7\npct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according\nto official figures, and would be a new record.\n    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a\nrecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct\ncompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.\n    The change in yield estimates is due to very high\ntemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in\nthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and\nnorthern Buenos Aires province.\n    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean\npods empty, especially in Cordoba.\n    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since\nrainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.\n    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in\nBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There\nwas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.\n    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were\nable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent\nweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,\nsunflower and sorghum harvesting.\n    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though\nit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of\nrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.\n    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the\ntotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at\n3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85\nmln hectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected\nto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln\ntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct\nlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,\naccording to official figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of\ntotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two\nto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record\n3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be\nbetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than\nlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.\n    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared\nthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on\ncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.\n    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and\n1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln\nhectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest\nremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to\n22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Federal Reserve Board has\napproved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in\nunderwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase\nCommercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank\nholding company.\n    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was\nconsistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But\nit added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last\nweek could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might\nforce it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting\nactivities.\n     The Fed said the application was similar to that of\nBankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was\napproved last December.\n    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90\nbillion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New\nYork and operates in the United States and abroad.\n    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade\nassociation of the investment banking industry, had opposed\nChase Manhattan's application for more powers.\n    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial\npaper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.\n     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place\ncommercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates\nand maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was\ngiven authority to do.\n    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and\npurchased would be 250,000 dlrs.\n    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking\nlaws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial\npaper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of\ntotal market share.\n    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to\nChase Manhattan's regular banking activities because \"this kind\nof instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional\ncommercial loan.\"\n    \"Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is\ncustomarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan,\" the Fed\norder said.\n    Among the benefits for the public will be increased\ncompetition in the commercial paper market and more convenient\nservice for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Treasury Secretary James Baker and\nFederal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House\nleaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work,\nbut acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the\nworse, Congressional sources and U.S. officials said.\n    Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks \nyesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.\n    But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy\ngave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote\neconomic growth and reform.\n    \"They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,\"\none participant at the meeting said.\n    However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretary\nof State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. \"And if\nthings turned sour, they could turn very sour,\" a source quoted\nthem as saying.\n    They were responding to questions from Wright, a Texas\nDemocrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his\nconcern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.\n    The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin\nAmerican democracy and the danger that demagogues of either\nleft or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.\n    Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more\nconfidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especially\nconcerned about the political risks, and in particular the \nfatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving\nthe debt crisis would be a \"struggle\".\n    Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year,\nWright has shown himself an able political adversary of the\nadministration on budget strategy.\n    His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that\nCongressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more\nseriously now than in the past.\n    More worrisome for administration strategists is the\npossibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially\ngranting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.\n    \"When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, they\nknew it wasn't just talk,\" one source at the meeting said.\n    The two economic policymakers listened patiently to\ndescriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backed\nby gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.\n    The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country\ndebt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking\neconomic reforms.\n    The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries\nfor their views under a bill approved by a House Banking\nsubcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York House\nDemocrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce\nMorrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.\n    The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders\nalso attended the discussions.\n    U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the\nadministration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday\nthe concept of debt relief was misguided. \"If we write it all\noff and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither\non the vine,\" the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital\ninflows that would follow debt relief.\n    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new\ninnovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.\n    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on\ncommercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major\ndebtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.\n    \"They sat down together to discuss the implications for\nLatin America and feel each other out on the best way out,\" a\nWright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect\nthe dialogue to continue.\n    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and\nan uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,\nDilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.\n    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power\nover the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister\nJoao Sayad is further reason to worry.\n    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial\nbanks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has\nbeen presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,\nbut did not come up yesterday.\n    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,\n\"is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American\nissue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger,\" said\nan aide, who asked not to be named.\n    There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by\ncommercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors\nfollowing substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.\n    At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultz\nis being advised the \"Baker plan is going through a rough patch\"\nwhile Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt\nmore flexible approaches to guarantee their continued\nparticipation in the plan.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Fleet Financial Group hopes its\nproposed merger with Norstar Bancorp <NOR>, ranked as the\nlargest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning\nof 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.\n    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for\nRhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring\nthe possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date\nfor the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July\none. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.\n    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that\nsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be\nconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate\nbanking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate\nthe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\"\nLougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in\nthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other\nbanking institution in the state.\n    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only\npermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be\namended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.\n    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,\nan option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase\nprovisions.\n    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New\nYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled\nup by the money center giants.\n    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet\nand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of\ninterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain\npermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.\nSupreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.\n    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed\nmerger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue\nto operate existing headquarters after the merger.\n    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one\nof theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one\nsplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the\ndeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.\n    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based\nSecurity Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion\n<RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is\nworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.\n    Chemical New York Corp's <CHL> acquisition of Texas\nCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion\ndlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer\ndeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC>\nand Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs\nand there have been several bank mergers in the southeast\nvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.\n    \"It's a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of\nMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at\nthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book\nvalue was 28.02 dlrs.\n    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his\n60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said\nKiernan would probably head the combined company until his\nretirement then Murray could assume the top post.\n    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said\nFleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986\non the basis of the merger terms announced today.\n    He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after\nhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has\nestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an\ninnovator in securitization of mortgages.\n    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion\ndlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar\noperates in most of New York state but not in New York City.\n    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations\nthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would\nbe combined.\n    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a\n\"lock-up\" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each\ngranted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued\nshares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares\noutstanding.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Financial analysts see little chance\nthat U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow\nranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.\n    \"We got a little volatility Wednesday,\" said Staley\nCommodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. \"But for the\nmoment we're still in a trading range.\"\n    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the\nU.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its\nsluggish state, the analysts said.\n    \"It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can\nbreak out of its very low volatility,\" said Carroll McEntee and\nMcGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. \"It needs something, but it's\nnot going to be news about the economy,\" he said.\n    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out\nof the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has\nstabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct\nmonetary policy.\n    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the\ndollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted\neager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.\n    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and\nmonetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn\nsaid the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back\ninto the marketplace.\n    \"The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the\nbeginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1,\" Quinn said.\n    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are\nlarge amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese\ninvestment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of\nJapan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond\nmarket, he said.\n    \"We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring\nyields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct,\" compared to\nthe current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.\n    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not\nlikely to move futures.\n    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding\noperation did little to move cash government securities prices\nlate Wednesday after the close of futures.\n    \"I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the\ntrading range),\" Lacey said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

U.S. firms have complained they\nwere not allowed to bid on its construction.\n    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the\nsubcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese\nproduct--digital audio recorders.\n    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means\nCommittee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against\nforeign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.\ntelecommunications products.\n     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.\ncompanies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of\ncounterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and\npatent laws.\n                                         \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Chilean left-wing leaders were\nelected by the copper workers union for the first time since\nthe left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in\na 1973 coup.\n     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement\n(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of\nCopperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in\nthe state-owned copper mines, union officials said.\n    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist\nparty and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the\nprincipal positions on the union's directorate.\n    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces\naround 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln\ntonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter\nand sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.\n    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's\ndirectorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian\ndemocratic party holding five and the remainder being won by\nindependents.\n    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after\nthe christian democrats and independents failed to reach\nagreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew\nfrom negotiations.\n    Union elections were called following the resignation of\nformer president Rodolfo Seguel last October.\n    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union\nleader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court\nactions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.\n    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national\nworkers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO\nfollowing a strike in 1983.\n    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the\npast 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against\nthe military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.\n     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union\nleader when no longer employed by the company.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs\nfrom the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its\naffiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.\n    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,\nwhich was included in the SEC filing, General Partners\nofficials said they were \"confident of our ability to promptly\nobtain the remaining funding as described in our offer\nmaterials.\"\n    \"For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a\nprompt consummation of the transaction,\" General Partners said.\n    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer\nfor GenCorp.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But the U.S. cannot\nstop subsidies alone, Shultz said. \"We have to agree to\ndismantle these systems together,\" he said.\n    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead\nin agricultural reform, he said.

The increased cost\nof using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation\nDepartment instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said\nTransportation has so far contributed no money.\n    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected\nto resolve the matter, USDA officials said.\n    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural\nService said yesterday the requirement that more food aid\nshipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to\nmeet.\n    \"As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,\nits going to be harder and harder to meet,\" Kay said.\n    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn\nEnglish (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export\nprograms more costly and the program should be eliminated.\n    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference\nhave been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who\nview cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Property looks set to continue to\nprovide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia\nand Australia this year.\n    A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economists\naround the region shows better returns are often more likely to\ncome from buying and selling real estate than from rental\nincome.\n    In central Tokyo, property analysts project commercial land\nprices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's\n53.8 pct jump.\n    The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is\nTokyo, where the top price paid for a central commercial\nproperty last year was 169,000 dlrs a square meter. A building\nin land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.\n    But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply\nincreases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach\nof foreign investors.\n    Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spending\nrecord sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, but\nin particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment could\ndouble this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.\n    The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will\nrise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in\nconstruction will limit increases in some areas.\n    Property sales have become increasingly popular because in\nsome sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several\ncities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.\n    \"We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see\nwhy the trend should not continue over the next few months,\"\nsaid Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong.\nBut he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk\nlinked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.\n    In several other countries, analysts predicted at least\nsome rise in property values, which in one or two cases, such\nas Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.\n    Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least\nseven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a\nresult of government assistance, low mortgage rates and a\ngenerally bullish economic outlook.\n    Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the\noutlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, one\nPhilippine developer said.\n    Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after\nfive years in the doldrums, according to property developers in\nTaipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region's\ncapitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.\n    One leading broker said the property market had become an\nattractive investment in Taiwan, noting property development\nyields of up to 15 pct.\n    Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Construction\nhas helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s,\nthough foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on\nproperty ownership, as in many parts of Asia.\n    In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreign\ninvestment in property, combined with financial deregulation\nand a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in the\nmarket, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.\n    \"What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularly\nfrom Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new deals\nbeing done,\" said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate)\nof Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.\n    Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct,\nand one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after\n15 pct rises in each of the past two years.\nREUTER...\n\u0003",

        "body": "The strong contribution of exports to\nthe growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the\nfourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of\nthe data, private economists polled by Reuters said.\n    Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after\nrising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year\nearlier.\n    Equally significant was the decline in both private and\ngovernment spending, they said.\n    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth\nquarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau\nfigures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government\nspending by 0.2.\n    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd said the government's aim of reducing the current account\ndeficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut\nimports appeared to be working.\n    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep\ngrowth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports\nwould increase and worsen the balance of payments.\n    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the\nresult was positive because growth was export-driven.\n    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the\ngrowth in exports disclosed in other statistics.\n    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul\nKeating in a statement issued in Canberra.\n    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a\nreduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline\nin domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.\n    A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter\nunderscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and\npublic sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's\ncompetitiveness, he said.\n    \"It is clear that through the continued application of that\nstrategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its\nexternal accounts and return to a more sustainable growth\npattern,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

This week the index passed the 360 level for\nthe first time after starting the New Year on 264.82.\n    Dealers have said prices would continue to gain this year\nin view of good prospects for the economy and an expected\npartial opening of the market to direct foreign investment.\n    However, some analysts are concerned about potential risks\nsuch as South Korea's unstable domestic politics and the lack\nof market sophistication.\n    Despite the doubts, the new fund is attracting offers in\nLondon and shares are trading at a premium of 40 to 60 pct over\ntheir 10 dlr issue price, said officials of Ssangyong\nInvestment Company, one co-lead managers.\n    The offer is co-lead managed by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd\nof Britain and underwritten by 44 international banks and\ninstitutional investors, including eight South Korean\nsecurities firms.\n    A foreign securities analyst told Reuters the South Korean\nsecurities firms underwiting the issue were \"greedily asking for\nhigh premiums\" in reponse to big demand.\n    The portfolio will be managed on the London Stock Exchange\nby Korea Schroder Fund Management Ltd, a joint venture between\n<Schroders Plc> of Britain and four South Korean securities\nhouses.\n    At the moment, foreigners can only invest in the local\nmarket indirectly through five locally-run trusts worth a total\nof 140 mln dlrs, and the Korea Fund in New York.\n    But the government is expected to announce guidelines for\ndirect outside investment on the market by October, when\nforeigners holding convertible bonds issued by <Samsung\nElectronics Co Ltd> will have the option to trade them for\nshares.\n    Samsung issued 20 mln dlrs worth of convertible bonds in\nDecember 1985, the first of three South Korean firms so far to\ntake the step.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Higher world oil prices, coupled with a\nnew realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's\neconomy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget\ndeficits, bankers and diplomats said.\n    The months ahead will prove critical as the government\nattempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices\nand fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private\nsector.\n    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to\nabout 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could\ngrow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.\n    But the economists said this will be possible only if the\nOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds\nin defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced\nto curtail output for too long.\n    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend\nOPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.\n    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at\nabout three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi\nArabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.\n    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's\nnew-found determination to defend prices in a move Western\ndiplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a\nstable source of income for its economy.\n    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a\nhugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining\nrevenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross\ndomestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.\n    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10\ndlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion\ndlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.\n    \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not\nbe allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can\nafford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst\neffects,\" a diplomat said.\n    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of\nlower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on\nforeign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.\n    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers\nand diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in\nthe longer term.\n    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a\ntime when the government is publicly urging private enterprise\nto take over the lead role in the economy.\n    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of\nthe risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it\nout\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion\nof reserves.\n    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion\nriyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly\nrecognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign\nborrowing has been ruled out.\n    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi\nbusinessmen this week the government had carefully considered\nthe need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget\nplans late last year.\n    \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50\nbillion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the\neconomy,\" he said.\n    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early\n1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and\ntales of high spending became legendary.\n    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the\nfabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management\nhad gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.\n    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,\nmarkets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut\nback. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.\n    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but\nSaudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate\nsector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.\n    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate\ncompany complaints about late public sector contract payments\ncould boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's\nindustrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.\n    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and\nmore cash being placed on deposit.\n    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic\ndevelopment from the public to the private sector, one of the\nbiggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel\npersonal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom\nand refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.\n REUTER\n\u0003",
