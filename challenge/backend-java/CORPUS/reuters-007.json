        "body": "Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S>\nsaid that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the\nimpact of changes in the Australian tax system.\n    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to\n25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln\na year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30\nmln from 44.29 mln.\n    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in\ncompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on\nfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the\ncompany said in a statement.\n    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue\ngrowth in the television industry as another reason for the\nflat first half earnings.\n    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of\nthese factors.\n    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning\nHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as\ndid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely\nsatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.\n    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0\npct rise in revenue, it said.\n    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net\nearnings because group borrowings were reduced following the\nreceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <Australian\nAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's \"B\"\nshares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>.\n    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.\n    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the\nfull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr\nacquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne\nwill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in\nSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further\nslash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its\nsemiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.\n    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the\nsemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price\nJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to\ntake retaliatory action after April 1.\n    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling\ncut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of\nAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.\n    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been\npressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will\nboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.\n    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to\nreduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,\nthey had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks\nof the first quarter.\n    If that reduced production level were maintained through to\nthe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct\nbelow that of the first three months of the year.\n    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the\nministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second\nquarter cutback.\n    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in\nAsia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there\nare picking up.\n    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese\nsemiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts\nto ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Ecuador is seeking between 437 and 450\nmln dlrs in loans this year from multilateral organisations and\nforeign governments to grapple with economic losses from a\ndevastating earthquake 13 days ago, a presidential economic\nadviser said.\n    Foreign governments and multilateral organisations hold\none-third of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs total foreign debt, he\nsaid in a news conference at the presidential palace.\n    But he added that the suspension of payments to private\nforeign banks, who hold the rest of the foreign debt, would be\nprolonged though the government hoped to negotiate an agreement\nwith these creditors.\n    President Leon Febres Cordero says the earthquake cost the\ncountry one billion dlrs in losses and left 1,000 people dead\nor missing.\n    Swett, who was Finance Minister of Ecuador between August\n1984 to June 1986, added: \"With the private foreign banks there\nhas been a ceasing of payments by Ecuador.\n    \"We are bringing forward the respective negotiations whose\nconclusion we hope finalises in the next few weeks.\"\n    Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said last week that\nquake-hit Ecuador sought through negotiations to postpone all\npayments due to the private foreign banks in 1987 until next\nyear.\n    Although Swett gave no gave details on the latest plan for\nnegotiations with private foreign banks, he calculated the\nsuspension of payment to these creditors would save the\ngovernment 54.45 billion sucres.\n    This amount is equal to 363 mln dlrs at the free rate of\n150 sucres to the dollar -- the rate Swett said reporters\nshould use in calculating the dollar equivalent.\n    The Ecuadorean central bank, which is the institution\nremitting debt payments abroad, uses the official rate of 95\nsucres to the dollar for its accounting purposes. At the\nofficial rate, the 54.45 billion sucres' sum equals 573 mln\ndlrs.\n    Ecuador, squeezed by a slide last year in prices for crude,\nits main export, suspended payments to private foreign banks in\nJanuary.\n    Swett said the government would also seek to refinance the\n1.429 billion dlr section of the debt owed to the Paris Club\ngroup of foreign governments, though it would continue to\nservice the debt with them. He gave no more details.\n    The government adopted a tough austerity program last\nFriday intended to grapple with the tremor's economic costs.\nBut the country's labour unions have called a general strike\nfor Wednesday to press for a suspension of the program.\n    The 500,000-strong Unitary Workers' Front (FUT) and the\n100,000-member General Union of Workers (UGT) called the strike\nto cancel the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices\nof up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.\n    The leftist-led FUT said it was also backing a call by the\nMaoist Popular Movement for Democracy (MPD) party, to have\nCongress impeach and oust Febres Cordero, a conservative, for\nhaving adopted the austerity measures.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This\nwas 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and\n41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.\n    The bank official noted M-3, which includes M-1 money\nsupply, plus savings, time deposits and deposit substitutes.\nWas 132.88 billion pesos at the end of December 1985.\n    M-1 money supply rose a provisional 17.3 pct to 42.86\nbillion pesos at the end of December 1986 from 36.52 billion a\nmonth earlier.

Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.\n    The sources said that with France's economic targets for\n1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the\ngovernment had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at\nan artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

These institutions have proposed\nthe creation of a limited service bank category.\n    Financial institutions in Hong Kong are now classified into\nthree types -- banks, registered and licensed deposit-taking\ncompanies.\n    Fell said the Commission is reviewing the three-tier\nstructure in light of the possible changes in capital ratio and\nthe growing trend towards securitisation of debt.\n    Fell said the Commission is also studying a set of\nguidelines on loan loss provisions with the help of the Society\nof Accountants.\n    Other planned guidelines relate to securitisation of debt\nand business that banks and deposit taking companies can\nconduct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brisk increases in personal income and\nconsumption are to appear in February data released today, but\nthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no\nmajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger than\nexpected, economists said.\n    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,\ncompared with no change in January, while consumption\nexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,\nreversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.\n    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be\nreleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    \n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc\nexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage\nand salary disbursements in February.\n    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the\naverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by\nfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable\ngoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at\nleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.\n    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond\nmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping\njust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.\n    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow\nrange, desperately seeking direction.\n    \"Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond\nmarket,\" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co\nInternational Inc.\n    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the\nsteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some\nsigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations\nthat inflation will remain subdued.\n    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.\n    \"It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation\nwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned\nthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five\npct inflation is a real possibility ahead,\" Boltz said in a\nreport.\n    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were\nindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The banking sector has regained its\nstability after a protracted period of difficulty, banking\ncommissioner Robert Fell said.\n    \"The banking climate has dramatically changed from a year\nago,\" he said at a news conference to present his annual report\non the banking sector for 1986.\n    \"We've got confidence back. We've got profitability back.\" he\nsaid.\n    A three-year shake out in the local banking sector forced\nthe government to take over three banks and arrange for the\nacquisition of four others by the private sector.\n    Fell said that in many cases the bank problems stemmed from\nmanagement fraud which he linked partly to dramatic swings in\nthe stock and property markets in the early 1980s.\n    \"We've got it out of the system now,\" he said. \"Fraud is no\nlonger a systemic problem.\"\n    But he acknowledged there may still be problems.\n    \"Deliberate fraud is difficult to detect especially where\ncollusion and senior management are involved,\" he said.\n\"Prudential supervision cannot give complete protection. The\n(new banking) ordinance is designed to give a \"measure\" of\nprotection.\"\n    Fell said a number of banks want to set up operations in\nHong Kong, adding the government approved three banking\nlicences this week. He did not give details.\n    At the end of 1986, there were 151 licenced banks, 25 of\nwhich were locally incorporated, compared with 143 a year ago.\nAnother 134 foreign banks had representative offices compared\nwith 131 a year ago.\n    There were 34 licensed deposit-taking companies (DTCs) and\n254 registered DTCs at the end of 1986, compared with 35 and\n278 respectively a year ago, he said.\n    Foreign banks seeking banking licences in Hong Kong must\nhave assets of 14 billion U.S. Dlrs. But Financial Secretary\nPiers Jacobs said yesterday the asset criteria are flexible.\n    A high asset threshold has worked in the favour of banks\nincorporated in countries with relatively large economies, he\nnoted.\n    \"No licences in the last few years have been granted to\nbanks from any of the smaller countries in the Asia-Pacific\nregion,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

One\nimportant reason for this was the bourse turnover tax, which\nwas reducing the rate of return to the investors.\n    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said this\nweek he believed the tax could still be removed, even if its\nabolition was not decided during recent coalition discussions.\n    Karl-Herbert Schneider-Gaedicke, deputy management board\nchairman of DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, said German\ndomestic and institutional investors had also shown\nreservations about investing in participation shares.\n    One of the reasons was the widely varying terms and\nconditions of participation shares in West Germany. \"The\ninvestor has to scrutinize (participation shares) carefully,\nbefore making an investment decision,\" Schneider-Gaedicke said.\n    He added the attractiveness of participation shares could\nbe increased by limiting the combination possibilities of terms\nand conditions and increasing safeguards for investors.\n    He also urged publicizing the comparative advantage of\nparticipation shares over ordinary shares for foreigners.\n    Foreigners do not receive the corporation tax bonus granted\nto domestic investors for share dividends.\n    Karl Thomas, head of the Bundesbank's credit department,\nsaid the domestic investor had missed earnings opportunities\nover the last four years by failing to invest in German bonds.\n    Domestic investors did not believe interest rates would\ndecline and stay at low levels for such a long time, because\nexpectations were determined by sharp interest rate\nfluctuations at the start of the decade.\n    The Bundesbank has a natural interest in seeing domestic\nsavings channelled into bonds and shares, Thomas said.\n    A shift of savings into long-term assets would dampen\nmonetary expansion and foster a stable rise of the money\nsupply, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Swissair <SWSZ.Z> said that the order\nfor McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> MD-11 long haul jets confirmed\nthis morning was worth a total 1.2 billion Swiss francs.\n    President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had not\nyet been decided whether the planes would have General Electric\nCo <GE.N>, Pratt and Whitney <UTX> or Rolls Royce engines.\n    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than the\nrival A-340 of the European Airbus consortium because it met\nbetter the Swissair requirements and would be able to enter\nservice in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC-10s it\nreplaces.\n    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its whole\nfleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order of\nfive more long-haul planes in addition to the six announced\ntoday. He said it would decide on the basis of the development\nof traffic whether these five would be MD-11s or Boeing 747s.\n    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissair\nmight eventually choose A-340s. \"We cannot afford to operate\nthree different types of aircraft,\" he said.\n    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise its\noption to buy Airbus A-310s, of which it already operates nine,\nofficials said. But it would still hold the options open.\n    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of the\nMD-11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for the\nplanes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.\n    Company officials said that Swissair intended to cover\naround 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC-10 replacement\nprogramme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raise\nthe remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital markets\nthrough issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or through\na capital increase.\n    The first such bond issue would likely come this year, they\npredicted.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.K. Treasury said its 1987/88\nbudget arithmetic which was unveiled on Tuesday \"took full\naccount of likely proceeds\" from the sale of the government's\nremaining 31.7 pct stake in British Petroleum Co PLC (BP.L).\n    A statement issued by the Treasury said \"the BP announcement\ntherefore makes no difference to our estimate of privatisation\nproceeds in 1987/88, or to subsequent years, which remains 5.0\nbillion stg a year.\"\n    \"It makes no difference to the PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing\nRequirement) which the Chancellor set in the budget,\" it said.\n    \"It has nothing to do with the future scope for tax cuts.\"\n    The Treasury's move was prompted by press speculation,\nofficials said, which followed last night's surprise\nannouncement by the government. It currently holds about 578.5\nmln shares in BP.\n    The Treasury statement said that the sell-off \"is simply a\npart of the government's continuing privatisation programme,\nthe overall size of which was announced in the Autumn\n(economic) Statement\" (last November).\n    It said the BP proceeds \"will be received in installments,\nof which the first will be in 1987/88.\"\n    News of the privatisation weighed down both BP's share\nprice in London and the equity market overall, market sources\nsaid.\n    The prospect of so much more BP paper in circulation had\ncut BP shares at 1340 GMT to 824 pence from yesterday's London\nclose of 828 pence. The company's shares had been down as low\nas 802 pence before rebounding, stock market sources said.\n    Worries over the ability of the London stock market to\ndigest the BP and other privatisation issues sent the Financial\nTimes/Stock Exchange 100 Share Index down 9.1 points by 1340\nGMT to 1997.5 from last night's close. At one point the index\nwas as low as 1989.1, the sources said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The results of a controversial study\nof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the\nhighest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy\nfarmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from\nsubsidies.\n    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD\nbecause of objections from some countries, were provided to\nReuters by officials of several countries on condition they not\nbe identified.\n    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for\nthe years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer\nsubsidy equivalent, PSE.\n    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the\namount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged\n83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct\nand the United States 48.2 pct.\n    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and\nthe U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC\n13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.\n    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct\ncompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.\nJapan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC\nand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.\n    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the\nEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.\n    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial\ncountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most\ncases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and\nJapan, the sources said.\n    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing\ncountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD\nwork.\n    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to\nrelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD\nministerial meeting in Paris during May.\n    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a \nbasis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade\ntalks now underway in Geneva.\n    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit\nto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting\npoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.\n    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate\ndown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of\nthe present crisis in world agriculture.\n    However, the OECD study results are controversial because\nthey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials\nfamiliar with the study said.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service\nrecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to\nverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.\n    In some cases the results were substantially different than\nthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and\nelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base\nperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.\n    For example, the USDA study found the United States\nsubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49\npct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.\n    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,\nciting the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told\nreporters last week that the United States subsidizes its\nfarmers more than the EC.\n    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably\nhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.\n    Officials of several countries have been asked to\ncontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to\n1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the\ncurrent world farm situation.\n    The updated calculations, which may take several months to\ncomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.\nsubsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive\nimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.\n    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm\nbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to\ngrain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials\nadded.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct\ndrop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,\nin line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut\nits payout to 33 francs per share from 38.\n    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the\nfirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would\nat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on\noutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.\n    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on\nSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of\n27 mln francs the previous year, he said.\n    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68\nmln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs\nin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20\nmln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on\nthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.\n    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276\nmln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.\n    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln\nfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45\nmln francs supplementary depreciation.\n    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made\nthis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate\nfluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.\n    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in\nthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel\nprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc\nagainst other European currencies.\n    \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries\nshrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate\ntrends therefore hit us much more severely than most other\nairlines.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The existing buffer stock of about\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250\nmln dlrs.\n    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at\nthis semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in\nworld cocoa prices.\n    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles\nas a basis for negotiations.\n    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A\nworking group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle\nthe buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO\nexecutive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version\nof a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates\nsaid.\n    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication\nof prospects for an accord after details of the rules are\nelaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet\nseparately later today to examine the scheme.\n    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to\nnon- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system\nfor buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be\npaid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates\nsaid.\n    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast\ndelegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to\nwork out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into\neffect as soon as possible, Baron said.\n    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of\nthe ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday\nto attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry\nof Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.\n    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council\nsession because of a conflicting International Sugar\nOrganization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,\ndelegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Share\nof exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.\n    Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.\n    Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of\nthe dollar and currencies in other important markets.\n    Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11\nyear at a \"high level,\" Porsche said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A new market has emerged in warrants to\nbuy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play\nof commodity options into the field of securities.\n    Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks\nhave launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying\nconditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the\nrecovery of the gold price last year.\n    And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each\nissued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a\nsimilar character, though they are aimed at a less professional\nmarket.\n    The market is still small. Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Jefferies Group Inc said founder\nand chairman Boyd L. Jefferies has resigned and intends to\nplead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal\nsecurities laws.\n    The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the company\never engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the company\never sought or communicated insider information or violated ny\ntrust of confidence placed in them by customers.  It said no\ngovernmental authority has ever alleged any such activity on\nBoyd Jefferies' part or the part of the company.\n    The company said Boyd Jefferies has consented to an\nadministrative order barring him from the securities business\nfor at least five years and he has agreed to place his 13 pct\nholding in Jefferies Group stock in a voting trust during that\nperiod.\n    The company said, without admitting any allegations made by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, Boyd Jefferies,\nJefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies and\nCo also consented to an injunction barring any future\nsecurities laws violations.\n    It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertake\nreviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and other\ncontrol systems are in compliance with federal laws.\n    The company said president and chief operating officer\nFrank E. Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executive\nofficer.  Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive.\n    The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferies\nresulted from a transaction in which, on behalf of Jefferies\nand Co, he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlled\nby Ivan F. Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boesky\nfirms.\n    It said \"Within days of the purchase, the market value of\none of the stocks fell sharply and, pursuant to their\nagreement, a Boesky entity paid Jefferies and Co three mln dlrs\nto offset the loss.\n    The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that following\nthe loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mln\ndlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services,\nalthough Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as an\noffset to the losses it experienced.\n    It said by rendering the involice, Boyd Jefferies\napparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a false\nentry in its books, resulting in the charge, to which Boyd\nJefferies will plead guilty, of aiding and abetting one of the\nBoesky firms in making false entries on its books.\n    The company said Boyd Jefferies will also plead guilty to a\nmargin violation resulting from a transaction in which he\ncaused Jefferies and Co to buy shares at the request of a\ncustomer in the company's trading account.\n    It was expected that the customer would be responsible for\nany loss on the shares and would also receive any profit, and\nbecause the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase,\nBoyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to finance\nthe full purchase price for the shares in violation of margin\nrequirements, the company said.\n    The company quoted Boyd Jefferies as saying, \"I fully\naccept sole responsibility for these transactions.  I think it\nis appropriate that I suffer the consequences for my actions\nrather than the company.\"\n    Jefferies Group said it expects no impact on its operations\nor client base from Boyd Jefferies' departure.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Earlier, the department estimated\nJanuary personal income was unchanged.\n    The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase\nsince a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. It\nattributed last month's rise to several factors, including\nsubsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises.\n    The department said personal consumption expenditures were\nup during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9\nbillion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct in\nJanuary.\n    Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs last\nmonth after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January with\nsales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February\nincrease and the January decline, the department said.\n    Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in February\nafter a 300 mln dlr increase in January.\n    The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were\nup 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr rise\nin January.\n    Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs last\nmonth after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gains\nwidespread through durable and nondurable industries, the\ndepartment said.\n    Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in February\nafter declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both last\nmonth's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was because\nof government subsidy payments, the department said.\n    Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs in\nFebruary following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The \ndeclines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a\nmonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federal\nnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.\n    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up\n1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after\nrising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.\n    The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February from\nfour pct in January, the department said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They included a 45.8 pct\nincrease in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.\n    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at\n8.64 billion marks.\n    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct\nyield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits\ntotalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the\nprevious year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.\n    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.\n    Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the\ncurrent business year, with financial reserves in the first\nfive months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing\nby 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.\n    He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according\nto the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and\nearnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.\n    The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at\nthree marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference\nshares.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Current interest by Soviet charterers in\ntaking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To\ncarry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent\nsurge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures\nExchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.\n    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for\nthe first time in the spot position since the market opened in\nMay 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values\nsome 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is\ncalculated on spot physical rates.\n    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but\nthey have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about\n50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would\nnormally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.\n    \"It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect\non its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported,\" one said.\n    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have\nsubsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering\nconditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for\nthe remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen\nsteadily for vessels loading next month.\n    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering\ntaking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.\n    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese\noperators may be in the market for similar timecharter business\nlater in the year, they said.\n    They anticipate this would appear around June and it has\nprompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it\nnormally being a slack time in the shipping year.\n    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates\nturned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had\nsupported the market at the start of the year, faltered but\nthen recovered on the reported Soviet interest.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Turkey's external debt rose to the\nequivalent of 31.4 billion dlrs at end-1986 from 25.4 billion a\nyear earlier, Treasury Under-secretary Yavuz Canevi said.\n    Canevi, who gave the figure at a briefing on the Turkish\neconomy arranged for Ankara-based diplomats, said the\nshort-term component was 9.6 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from\n6.6 billion.\n    Much of Turkey's debt is denominated in currencies other\nthan the dollar. Canevi said the increase expressed in dollar\nterms was partly attributable to the fall in value of the U.S.\nCurrency.\n    While the rise in total debt was about 24 pct in dollar\nterms, it would be only 11 pct if expressed in special drawing\nrights and would represent a fall of 11 pct if expressed in the\nWest German mark, he said.\n    On the rise in short-term debt, Canevi said half the amount\nwas in Turkish citizens' foreign exchange deposits. \"On a macro\nlevel it is a liability but it is not really a liability\nbecause it will be repaid in Turkish lira,\" he added.\n    Canevi was Governor of the Turkish Central Bank until last\nNovember, when he was promoted to Under-secretary for the\nTreasury and Foreign Trade, a key economic management post.\n    Canevi listed what he called the assets of the Turkish\neconomy, including liberalisation in the last three years, the\ncountry's geographical position and the strength of its\nagriculture and manpower skills.\n    The debt picture was one of three liabilities, he said,\nalong with the failure to reduce inflation swiftly and\nimpatience. \"We are an impatient nation ... We should be patient\nenough to achieve better results,\" he added.\n    Wholesale prices on an index issued by Canevi's department\nrose 27.4 pct in the year to February, compared with 33.3 pct a\nyear earlier.\n    On inflation, Canevi said: \"We have chosen to reduce\ninflation in a moderate way. We could have reduced it in two\nyears from 25 pct to five pct but we needed growth ... We\nalready have high unemployment.\"\n    \"I don't blame people who are sick and tired of living with\ninflation but it was 100 per cent before. The trend is down, so\nlet's be patient and not distort overall policies and we will\nachieve our targets in one or two years,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986\nwas adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins\nat the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an\nincrease in bad debt reserves.\n    Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.\nLutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve\nfinancial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which\nwere not adequate at the time of acquisition.\n    He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will\ndepend on the allocation of increased costs between the second\nand fourth quarters.\n    Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will\nbe restated, though final net income for the year will remain\nin the estimated range.\n    He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987\nrevenues were favorable.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and\nKorea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and\ncurrency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,\neconomists said.\n    \"The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in\n1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be\nscreaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve\nCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.\n    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.\nafter Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.\n    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,\nthe Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric\nagainst Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their\ncurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.\n    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized\ncountries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the\ncurrencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main\nfocus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to\nclose the competiveness gap for American goods.\n    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he\nexpects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.\n    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their\nown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not\nrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries\nof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and\nKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.\n    \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was\nJapan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of\nLloyds Bank PLC.\n    Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore\nand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170\nbillion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.\n    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade\ndeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.\n    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is\ncontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6\nbillion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The\ngap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.\n    Lately both nations have said they will take steps to\ndefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many\nof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import\ntariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.\n    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last\nweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to\nfive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut\ntariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and\ntry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang\nChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect\nTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.\n    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles\nand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the\narea of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars.\n    Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America\n-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.\n    \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When\ntheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing\nbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob\nWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.\n    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,\n72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its\ntelecommunications equipment.\n    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and\nSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.\n    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the\nU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.\n    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in\nmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into\nlarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade\nand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.\n    Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to\n18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and\nKorea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.\n    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.\n    \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been\nat Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.\n    February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers\nexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.\n    But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response\nfrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work\nwith a sizeable lag, economists say.\n    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and\nKorea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is\npegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since\nSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.\n    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against\nthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.\n    \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those\ncountries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said\nBethlehem Steel's Wendt.\n    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their\nhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.\n    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will\nget given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to\nsee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then\nthe question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "European Community (EC) industry\nministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of\nclosures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country\nbloc into reasonable balance with demand.\n    The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary\nplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer\nwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.\n    Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the\nscheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for\ndiscussion, but did not go nearly far enough.\n    Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of\nplants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,\nprovided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC\nor national governments for redundancy and other social costs.\n    But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry\nCommissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln\ntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should\nbe closed by the end of 1990.\n    He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint\nthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,\ntypically produced in plants employing thousands of people.\n    The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis\nthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to\nclose.\n    They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be\nexpanded and developed through meetings among the industry\nbody, the Commission and representatives of member states.\n    However, diplomats said it was clear from today's\ndiscussions that such meetings will be difficult.\n    They said member states are split on whether to reduce the\nscope of a quota production system, which at present protects\nEC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of\ntheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.\n    It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which\nEC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on\nhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work should\ncome from Community coffers.\n    German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel\nindustry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer\nproportionately more than others, German sources said.\n    But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,\ninsists that the profitability of companies should be taken\ninto account.\n    The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from\nmassive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is\ncurrently one of the few EC steel companies in the black.\n    Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint\nstatement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the\nindustry.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In animal tests, which\nincluded primates, Egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizing\nantibodies to the AIDS virus and broader cellular immunity.\n    Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver its\nvaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer than\nvaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found on\nthe surface coat of the AIDS virus.\n    Yesterday, Bristol-Myers Co <BMY> said it would seek\nregulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine, which uses a\nsmallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.\n    Repligen's AIDS vaccine is a collaborative effort of the\ncompany, Centocor Inc <CNTO>, Duke University Medical School\nand the National Cancer Insitutes. The research teams are\ndirected by John Ghrayeb of Centocor, Scott Putney of Repligen,\nDani Bolognesi at Duke and Robert Gallo and Flossie Wong-Staal\nat the National Cancer Institute.\n    Although there are several AIDS vaccine candidates, experts\nbelieve that development of a safe and effective vaccine is a\nlong ways away. Moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine is\nonly the first step in a long process of verifying if the\nvaccine actually will prevent infection.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Britoil Plc's <BTOL.L> exploration\nexpenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a\nthird of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would\nremain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker\nsaid.\n    He told reporters following the release of the company's\n1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986\nlevels.\n    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from\n184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from\n156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in\n1985.\n    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to\n134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary\ncharge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results\nwere slightly better than analysts forecast and the share\nfirmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir\nPhilip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986\nhad made the period extremely difficult but the company had\ncome through remarkably well.\n    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the\nconditions would be right for a substantially improved\nperformance this year.\n    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when\nthey were normally weaker, made him \"a bit encouraged\" about the\nprospects for future levels.\n    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price\nstayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.\n    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement\nof a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the\nlatter part of April.\n    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared\nwith 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this\nincluded a revised definition of reserves.\n    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the\nreserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels\npreviously.\n    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a\nrestated 3,660 billion.\n\u0003",

        "body": "GTE Corp is raising 250 mln dlrs\nthrough an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.737 pct,\nsaid sole underwriter UBS Securities Inc.\n    UBS, the U.S. unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, won the\nissue in competitive bidding against syndicates led by such\nmajor U.S. houses as First Boston and Morgan Stanley.\n    UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issue\nin the domestic debt market this year, following Daiwa\nSecurities America Inc. However, investment bankers noted that\nUBS was the first foreigner to break into the U.S. market when\nit won a competitive bidding in June 1986.\n    An officer on UBS's corporate syndicate desk said the GTE\nissue is the fourth that the securities firm has managed.\n    UBS bid the GTE debentures at 97.0025 and set a coupon of\n8-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 97.50 to yield 112 basis\npoints over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.\n    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-3 by\nMoody's and A-minus by Standard and Poor's.\n    GTE last tapped the debt market when it sold on November\n20, 1986, 250 mln dlrs of same-maturity, same-rated debt priced\nto yield 9.388 pct, or 174 basis points over comparable\nTreasury paper, underwriters noted.\n    Underwriters said that two of the UBS-lead offerings were\nnegotiated deals. UBS won the other two issues in competitive\nbidding acting as sole underwriter.\n    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,\nran the books for a March 11 offering of 200 mln dlrs of\n10-year notes of Rockwell International Corp <ROK>,\nunderwriters noted.\n    Thus far, Nomura Securities International Inc is the only\nother foreign firm to manage a U.S. debt offering. The U.S.\nunit of Nomura Securities Co Ltd of Japan, acting as sole\nunderwriter, won a competitive issue in early December 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This included\neight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being\nspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further\nlandslides.\n    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and\nhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any\nthreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.\n    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard\ncut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding\nthat he expected the canal board to determine whether and when\nthe canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Federal regulators said Boyd\nJefferies, who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokerage\nfirm, took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stock\nand in a stock \"parking\" plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky.\n    In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New\nYork, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies\nagreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a\nlarge chunk of stock being issued in a public offering.\n    Under the agreement, the firm, Jefferies and Co, drove the\nprice of the stock up by one-eighth point by buying four blocks\nof the stock at or near the close of trading, the SEC said.\n    Jefferies and Co's purchases of the unidentified stock\naccounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stock\non that day and were aimed at manipulation, the SEC said.\n    The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was\nbeing traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took\nplace sometime last year when another unidentified company,\nwhich owned a controlling interest in the company, sold several\nmillion shares of the stock in a secondary public offering.\n    The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock\nExchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said.\n    The person who made the alleged stock manipulation\nagreement with Jefferies was also not identified.\n    But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a\nphony invoice marked for investment banking services for the\nexact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the\nstock on the open market, the SEC said.\n    The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed in\nthe complaint, was made later by another unidentified person\nafter Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, the\nSEC said. The firm recorded the payment as \"other income,\" it\nsaid.\n    William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at the\nSEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealing\nthe identities of other persons and companies involved in the\nstock manipulation scheme.\n    \"We just made a determination that this was the way to go\nat this time,\" McLucas told Reuters.\n    The complaint went into far greater detail in its charges\nthat Jefferies agreed with Boesky to \"park\" stock at each\nother's firms. Parking, or warehousing, stock, refers to deals\nwhere stock is held by one person or firm under an arrangement\nwhere it is actually under the control of someone else.\n    Under the agreement between Jefferies and Boesky, Jefferies\nand Co would hold stock owned by Seemala Corp, one of Boesky's\nbrokerage firms, for 31 days, after which Seemala would \"buy\"\nthe stock back, the SEC said.\n    Seemala realized all gains and sustained all losses on the\nstock held by Jefferies and Co during the period, agreed to\ncompensate Jefferies and Co for carrying the stock and to pay\nmore than twice Jefferies and Co's usual commission, it said.\n    Seemala then agreed to hold stock owned by Jefferies and Co\nfor a month under terms about the same as the deal in which\nSeemala agreed to park its stock at Jefferies and Co, it said.\n    The agreement, which violated several securities laws,\nallowed Seemala to create a false appearance that no longer\nheld the stock and could meet the SEC's net capital\nrequirements, the SEC said.\n    Jefferies wanted Seemala to hold some of its stock, the SEC\nsaid, so that Jefferies and Co could meet its net capital\nneeds, the agency said.\n    On March 12, 1985, Seemala \"sold\" Jefferies 810,000 shares\noc Cooper Laboratories Inc for 11.7 mln dlrs, 600,000 shares of\nSouthland Financial Corp for 17.3 mln dlrs and 500,000 shares\nof G.D. Searle and Co for 27.1 mln dlrs, it said.\n    On March 20, Jefferies and Co \"sold\" Seemala 185,500 shares\nof American Broadcasting Co for 19.6 mln dlrs, 210,000 shares\nof Ideal Basic Industries Inc for 2.9 mln dlrs, 300,000 shares\nof ITT Corp for 9.8 mln dlrs, 105,000 shares of Phillips\nPetroleum Co for 4.0 mln dlrs, 70,000 shares of Pioneer Corp\nfor 2.1 mln dlrs and 300,000 shares of Texas Oil and Gas Corp\nfor 5.3 mln dlrs, the SEC said.\n    The value of Seemala's stock at the time of the transfers\nwas 56 mln dlrs, while Jefferies and Co's stock was worth 43\nmln dlrs at the time, the SEC said.\n    Within a month, Seemala and Jefferies and Co unwound most\nof the stock transfers with each others firms, the SEC said.\n    But a major hitch developed in the deal when the price of\nSearle stock, which Jefferies and Co was holding for Seemala,\ndipped sharply, it said.\n    On March 26 Seemala \"bought\" back its Searle stock for 23.4\nmln dlrs, resulting in a 3.6 mln dlr loss for Jefferies and Co,\nthe SEC said. Seemala then allowed Jefferies and Co to \"buy\"\nback some it the stock Seemala was holding for it at a 647,812\ndlr gain and Boesky's firms later paid the Jefferies firm three\nmln dlrs, which it called \"fees,\" it said.\n    Among the violations Jefferies committed in the schemes,\nwere net capital, record keeping, public disclosure and margin\nrequirements, the SEC said.\n    Under the settlement of the civil SEC's charges, which was\nannounced simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,\nJefferies and his firm did not have to admit or deny guilt.\n    But they agreed to a court order barring them from further\nsecurities law violations.\n    Jefferies also agreed to get out of the securities business\nfor at least five years.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It then sells shares in\nthese to investors in the Gulf region.\n    ABC said Investcorp's facility can be used \"alternatively or\nsimultaneously\" through the following facilities:\n    - issue of euronotes and or advances through tender.\n    - extension of committed advances by the underwriting\nbanks, a so-called \"back-stop\" facility.\n    - issue of contingent obligations such as performance\nletters of credit, letters of guarantee or the receipt of\nquotations for interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and\ncollars from a panel of selected banks.\n    ABC said the final option gives Investcorp the right to\nrequest facilities on an uncommitted basis.\n    ABC said the facility has a maturity of three years from\nsignature, with bullet repayment.\n    It said the interest margin over London Interbank Offered\nRates (LIBOR) for the committed advances will be based on the\ntotal utilisation of the facility - 17.5 basis points for up to\none third, 20 basis points for up to two thirds and 22.5 points\nfor an amount above that level.\n    Banks are being invited to underwrite the facility at a\nflat fee of 0.325 pct for five mln dlrs, 0.275 pct for three to\nfour mln and 0.25 pct for one to two mln.

And while sources at Seguin's ministry said the\npackage could total 12 billion francs for 1987, sources close\nto Balladur, making no mention of public works, said only 8.6\nbillion francs had been set aside for capital endowments.\n    Seguin said the advantage of public works was that they\nwere non-inflationary and had a fast job-creating power.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it\nagreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell\ncondoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.\n    It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an\ningredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of\nAIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German\npublication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was\nabout the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the\ncondoms made by INKEY.\n    The company also said it is changing its name to\nEurocapital Corp shortly.\n    Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a\nU.S.-based <Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own\nthe remaining shares of the company, which was set up to\ndistribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are\nbeing developed by INKEY.\n    The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for\nthe distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30\ndays after the products are approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file\nwith the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval\nprocess to be a lengthy one.\n    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is\ncurrently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated\nto condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been\ntested in a spermicide.\n    Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand\nname, \"Carlton.\" The exclusive distribution contract for the\nproducts runs for three years and is renewable for one-year\nperiods, the company said.\n    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have\nnot gone on sale in other European countries.\n    It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the\nresources to make the payments under the distribution agreement\nor fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from\nthe FDA.\n    The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to\nacquire either one or more publicly held companies with little\nor no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar\nSystems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below\nits current 45 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Owners of two aluminum smelters in\nKentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates\nafter a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate\nhike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.\n    But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire\nAluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL>, said further\nviability of the operations would depend in part upon how the\nrate case is eventually settled.\n    \"We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for\nsure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter,\" a\nNational Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other\nvariables to consider in any decision whether to close or\ncontinue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles\nwest of Louisville.\n    National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc\n<NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which\nholds the rest, the spokesman said.\n    A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, \"The decision is\n48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a\nlong time before we can make a decision\" about what it means\nfor the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of\nLouisville. \"But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was\ndenied the requested rate increase.\"\n    A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates\nand wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the\nrequested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.\n    The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the\nincrease, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which\ninclude Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Irving Bank Corp\n<V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility\nspokesman said.\n    The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out\na flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index\ntheir electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.\n    \"We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to\nassure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable,\" he said.\n    No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned\nbetween the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant\nowners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for\nJuly 28.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Eder could receive up to five years in jail on each\ncount and 260,000 dlrs in fines.\n    Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentified\nsupervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currency\ntransaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cash\ntransactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to the\nIRS.\n    David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case,\nsaid Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000\ndlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amounts\nunder 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on several\ndifferent days.\n    Outside of Court, Eder's lawyer, Milton Gould, said his\nclient was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insider\ntrading scandel. Rather, Gould said, \"Eder accomodated some\nwealthy customers (who wanted to avoid taxes).\"\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Then, upon\nthe expiration of the futures, the manager looks to transform\nthat into a stock portfolio, he said.\n    The coming month is also a seasonally strong period for the\nstock market, Stotler and Co analyst David Hightower said,\nbecause of the influx of income tax refunds.\n    Although Hightower recommended steering clear of trading\nduring the witching hour, he suggested buying if the market\nplunges, believing that the slide would only be temporary.\n    Marcus said it was difficult to make a prediction as to\nwhich way the market will go on Friday, partly because many\ninvestors will be engaging in \"window-dressing.\"\n    The public disclosure of order imbalances in individual\nstocks a half hour before the close may reveal an opportunity\nto those investors seeking either to buy or get rid of stocks,\noffsetting whatever impact the initial imbalances show.\n    Analysts said efforts by exchanges to quell the volatility\non triple-expirations are unlikely to substantially alter the\nimpact of futures and options on the stock market. Money\nmanagers are sure to find other types of loopholes that emerge\nunder the new rules, they said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Consumers may benefit from new\ntelephone services if business restrictions against the\nregional Bell companies are eased, but safeguards against rate\nhikes may be needed, congressional and industry analysts say.\n    An easing of the restrictions by the U.S. District Court\nwould help bring new services to markets that the regional\nfirms are currently prohibited from serving, the analysts say.\n    But consumer groups add that there is a danger the regional\ncompanies would raise rates to subsidize entry into new markets\nand safeguards would be needed to prevent that.\n    Brian Moir, a spokesman for the International\nCommunications Association, a national group of telephone\nusers, said, \"If there are no safeguards, there will be higher\nrates, less competition and less consumer choice.\"\n    The seven regional Bell companies created from the breakup\nof American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> in 1984 have been\nprohibited by the terms of the divestiture decree from\nmanufacturing equipment, offering computerized information\nservices or providing long-distance service.\n    U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who presided over the\ndivestiture and continues to enforce its terms, is currently\nconsidering a Justice Department recommendation to eliminate\nthe restrictions except on long-distance service within a Bell\nholding company's local service region.\n    In separate filings last week, the regional Bells asked\nGreene to remove restrictions, while industry and consumer\ngroups including the Consumer Federation of America joined ATT\nin asking that all or most of them be retained.\n    ATT, which has about an 80 pct share in the interstate\nlong-distance market, said in its filing it would not oppose\nentry by the Bell companies into computerized information\nservices but was against their participation in long-distance\nservices and manufacturing equipment. ATT does not offer\ncomputerized information services.\n    ATT has asked the Federal Communications Commission, in a\nseparate proceeding, to reduce price and rate regulations that\nhave dominated the long-distance business for many years.\n    Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to ease\nrestrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said.\n    \"The restrictions prevent people who can provide services\nfrom providing them,\" said a congressional aide.\n    However, a major concern among consumer groups and\nlawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those new\nbusinesses from higher charges to their customers.\n    \"We're talking about activities funded directly or\nindirectly off the backs of ratepayers,\" said Moir.\n    One congressional aide said he was not worried about\nsubsidizing new businesses from profits, but he was concerned\nthat the Bell companies may overcharge consumers so that they\ncan invest in new services.\n    Some analysts said accounting regulations would protect\nconsumers against cross-subsidization by the Bell companies.\n    \"Those are types of things that really do need review,\" said\nGerry Salemme, an aide with the House Telecommunications,\nConsumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee.\n    He added that the House would hold hearings later this year\nto examine the potential effects of reduced restrictions.\n    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation, which represents\nmore than 200 consumer groups, said accounting regulations were\ninadequate because accountants could not separate equipment\nemployed for traditional and new services.\n    \"We have yet to see adequate regulatory safeguards that\nexist that prevent cross-subsidization by the Bell companies,\"\nKimmelman said. \"You're either asking for great increases in\nrates or a great opportunity for cross-subsidization.\"\n    One congressional aide expressed concern that lifting of\nthe restrictions would lead to joint ventures between U.S. and\nforeign firms in manufacturing telecommunications equipment and\nthat could lead to a loss of American jobs. He suggested some\nsafeguards may be needed to protect against that happening.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of\nthe negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.\n    \"The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents\na significant step forward in international economic\ncooperation,\" he told a news conference. The new INRA is to\nreplace the current one which expires in October.\n    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the\nauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new\naccord last weekend.\n    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of\n201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative\nprices set in the present pact.\n    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint\nMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.\n    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of\nprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and\nminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"\nand \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.\n    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that\nwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are\nto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between\ndemand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole\ninstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and\nits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto\nadded.\n    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in\ntwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be\nresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference\nprice.\n    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price\nevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.\n    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.\n    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator\nprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price\n(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower\nintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for\nsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or\nwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council\ndecides.\n    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these\ncircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a\nhigher adjustment.\n    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to\n300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three\npct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher\npercentage.\n    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had\nstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference\nprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150\ncents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently\n360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last\nFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.\n    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of\nthe new pact.\n    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the\nnew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments\naccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world\nimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became\noperational.\n    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Sugar which EC producers plan to sell\ninto intervention may be offered by the European Commission for\nsale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its\nlatest sugar review.\n    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very\nnominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the\nintervention price, with detrimental consequences for\nproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an\nattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered\nsugar.\n    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade\nproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the time\nlimit on storage contracts, which presently means that\nintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,\nCzarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production\nquotas being reduced.\n    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for\nexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at\nrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference\nbetween the EC price and the world market price, the extra\ncosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.\n    The producers might have to repay these costs through\nproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,\nCzarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs\ncould be recovered under EC rules.\n    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of\nsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the\nEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to\nbridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,\nCzarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of\nprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.\n    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for\nintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure\nthat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in\n1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,\nWest German producers face a further price reduction in July\nwith a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark.\n    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is\nnot expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to\ntraders for some years that the EC's export policy is\ninsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it\nsays.\n    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by\nincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,\nsuggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut\ndown the amount of \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" surrounding the\nexport tender system.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Association of German Cooperative\nBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates\nwould continue to remain low for the time being.\n    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong\nforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in\nthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market.\n    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for\nhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation\nlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in\nnominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.\n    The association said generally low interest rates,\nprospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected\nstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment\nclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continue\nits slow but very sure growth.\n    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest\nrates down on the short-term money market although its policies\nhad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,\nwhich was so important for investment financing and thus for\nthe course of the economy, it said.\n    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy\nhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, the\nassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy\nthrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.\n    On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking\ndogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.\n    The association said time would show to what extent\nspeculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic\nmoney would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank\ncould hold down money market rates with the highly effective\ninstrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Slower than expected growth in Britain's\nnarrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a\nfurther cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling's\nvalue requires such a move, economic analysts said.\n    M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after\nChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official\ntarget for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget\nspeech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.\n    On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2\npct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.\n    \"The M0 data are much better than we expected,\" said Robert\nThomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.\n    He and other analysts said while the better than expected\nM0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new\ninterest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.\n    Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite\nbuoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct\nafter a fall of the same size in January.\n    Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in\nconsumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not\nan adequate indicator to determine interest rates.\n    \"The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is\nimportant ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate\nand the election which call the tune,\" Lloyds Merchant bank\nchief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.\n    Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,\nsaid in a comment: \"It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to\nsignals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate\ntrends is necessary before action is taken.\"\n    \"With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are\nmade in response to signals from this narrow money variable,\nthe City has been forced to take it seriously,\" he added.\n    Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of\nlast year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.\n    This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.\nBase lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the\npound above unofficial targets, analysts said.\n    Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed\nbetween finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at\ntheir Paris meeting last month, they added.\n  U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the\nParis agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when\nforeign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut\nin 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.\n    They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and\nanalysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming\nweek.\n    Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than\nexpected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the\nannual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous\ntarget of 11 to 15 pct.\n    Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the\nimprovement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few\nmonths had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be\ndrawn after revised data are released on March 31.\n    Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to\nwatch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap it\naltogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its\ncredibility as a key factor in monetary policy.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A statement yesterday by Secretary\nof State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that\nU.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was\nsignificant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet\nmarket and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market\nlevels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.\n    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly\nendorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy\nbecause they were not negative towards such action.\n    In response to a query on what the State Department's\nposition is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told\nthe leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that\nprices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.\n    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has\nbought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the\nprice was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall\nto sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export\nenhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.\n    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat\noffer last year and has been reported to be one of the major\nobstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet\nUnion, grain industry sources said.\n    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat\noffer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in\nrecent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose\nanother 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,\nwhile CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.\n    \"I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a\nrecognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the\nSoviet Union,\" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.\n    \"We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that\nsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same\nthing at a lower price somewhere else,\" Shultz told the farm\nleaders. \"That is our approach in negotiations with the\nSoviets,\" he said.\n    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no\nlonger opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,\nit certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to\nMoscow, an industry lobbyst said.\n    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious\nattitude towards the secretary's comments.\n    \"His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our\njudgment promise any immediate action on EEP,\" an official with\nthe wheat group said.\n    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that \"there is\nsignificance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant\nnegative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.\"\n    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of\nAgriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request\nthat the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the\nofficials said.\n    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is\nreported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,\nsaid that the Shultz comments \"are consistent with what he\n(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,\" but said they\ndon't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.\n    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to\nLyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.\n    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may\nindicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.\n    \"If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is\npotentially a positive development,\" a commodity source said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It is restricted to new offshore developments\noutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.\n    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not\npaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly\nbenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.\n    \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators\nin those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said,\nadding that the timing of development of such fields may be\nadvanced.\n    The government would in effect be subsidising these\ndevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before\ncorporation tax, the report said.\n    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is\nof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will\nbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will\nrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.\n    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when\nthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying\nfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the\nU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a\nsmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9\npct.\n    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will\nbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only\nwill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's\nfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will\nbe lost.\n    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts\nwill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later\ntime.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Several leading farm-state\nCongressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment to implement some kind of marketing loan to make\nsoybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.\n    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman\nDan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and\nrepresentatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the\nsubject in the next two weeks.\n    \"Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do\nsomething without legislation,\" Glickman told the hearing.\n    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per\nbushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.\n    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president\nsaid USDA must make changes in the soybean program.\n    The current soybean program \"gave us the worst of both\nworlds,\" ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is\ntoo high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of\nsoybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,\nthe U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income\nsupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said.\n    \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added.\n    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture\nSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA\nso far has resisted pressure to use the authority.\n    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,\nbut Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they\nwould seriously consider offering a marketing loan.\n    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the\nsoybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studied\nextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any\nchanges, are under consideration.\n    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other\nthan a marketing loan which should be considered to help\nsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,\nor a direct payment program.\n    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit\nCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise\nto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of\nsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.\n    \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire\nsoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said.\n    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in\nmaking soybean program changes that might allow the European\nCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.\n    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean\nproduction and loss of that market would be devastating.\n    The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" on\nwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be\nsuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.\n    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu\nloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed\na proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six\ndlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.\n    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking\nRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward\nMadigan of Illinois.\n    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take\nsome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan\ncould mean a substantial increase in budget costs.\n    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one\nto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore\nmust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.\n    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu\ncombined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might\nfall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the\ngovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs\nwould decline as market prices recovered.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that\nrelatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with\nChemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase\nfrom last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.\n    Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with\nReuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected\nearnings to increase.\n    \"We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement\nover last because we are stronger,\" Love said, referring to\nTexas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.\nThe merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will\nlower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15\nbasis points, Love said.\n    The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition\nby a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved\ninterstate banking effective January 1.\n    Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'\nstruggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report\nprofits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which\nearned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6\nmln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5\nmln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is actively\nseeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln\ndlrs.\n    Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its\nenergy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's\nnonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.\n    \"I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,\" he\nsaid. \"The fact that the real estate market is still moving\naway suggests there could be some continuing growth of\nnonperforming loans.\"\n    In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses\nrelated to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy\nloan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the\nbank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43\npct.\n    More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,\nwhich totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln\ndlrs the year before, were in real estate.\n    Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for\nTexas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the\nthird or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office\nbuildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about\n30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four\nyears, he said.\n    \"I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil\nat 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a\nbarrel,\" he said.\n    Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate\nsubsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its\nholdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to\nbuild up its consumer banking business, Love said. \"We are\nresuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,\"\nhe said.\n    In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in\nMontgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,\nand earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas\nCommerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the\nDallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member\nbanks, he said.\n    One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced\nin December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>,\nboth headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued\nat 570 mln dlrs.\n    The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and\nInterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas\nbanking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion\nplans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. \"We think\nwe can try to get a little part of their roost,\" he said.\n    The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an\nedge in developing new consumer products, he said.\n    \"We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than\none million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us\nhow to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,\" he\nsaid, referring to expansion of such existing products as\ncredit cards and investment banking.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of\nthe president's council of economic advisors, said stronger\ndomestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to\nhelp stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher\ndollar declines.\n    \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign\nindustrial countries is needed to engender the much needed\nexpansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on\nfurther dollar depreciation,\" he told the Futures Industry\nAssociation.\n    Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in\nJapan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war\nperiod.\n    \"Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial\ncountries would help give balance to the current world\nrecovery,\" he said.\n    Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last\nmonth to trading partners, he said recent figures showed\nJapan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of\n1986, \"Not enough to sustain employment growth.\"\n    However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges\nand was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax\nreform. \"I suspect there will be further moves,\" he said.\n    Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S.\ngovernment spending and for resistance to tax increases.\n    \"Reducing the federal government budget deficit by\nexpenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal\ntax rates achieved by tax reform,\" he said, adding that \"a vote\nto increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax\nreform.\"\n    Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially\nrestored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration\nof the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.\n    However, he said that \"sole reliance on dollar depreciation\nto reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,\" as it risks\ninflation in the United States and recession abroad.\n    \"I am confident that further improvements in our trade\nperformance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,\" he\nsaid. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will\ncome about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and\npresent \"serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.\"\n    Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment\nhave been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the\nimprovement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.\n    He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in\nrates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable\npolicies that produced them.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He declined to elaborate.\n    Reports in the French press today indicated that ILFC was\nclose to signing an agreement to buy 27 of the A320 jets.\n    The total value of the order announced last week is 350 mln\ndlrs. The jets are scheduled for delivery beginning in 1991.\nHowever, the order for the A330s is conditional on a decision\nby the Airbus board to launch the plane.\n    Airbus has said it will decide by the end of this month\nwhether to launch the medium range A330 and the companion, long\nrange A340. It says it has 104 orders and options from nine\nairlines for the two planes.\n    ILFC is one of the launch customers for the A330,\nUdvar-Hazy noted.\n    Earlier today, Swissair dealt a blow to Airbus by opting to\norder six MD-11 long range aircraft from McDonnell Douglas Corp\n<MD>, Airbus's rival in the competition to provide a long range\npassenger plane alternative to Boeing Co's <BA> new versions of\nthe 747.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "American Express Co's plan to sell a\nstake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a\nprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,\nanalysts said.\n    American Express earlier said it has a general\nunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a\n13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.\n    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,\nas investors speculated on the possibility of more investment\nin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.\n    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to\nthe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.\nfirm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a\nprice of 2.7 times book value.\n    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,\ndepressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider\ntrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8\ntimes book value.\n    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For\nthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of\na spinoff of part of Shearson.\n    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will\nbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly\nimportant Tokyo financial markets.\n    \"I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,\" said\nLong.\n    \"What you will see probably in the future is American\nExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and\nhave a public vehicle for Shearson,\" Long said.\n    \"Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment\ninto an illiquid situation,\" he said of Nippon.\n    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in\nShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like\nother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.\n    American express has said the total employees of shearson\nwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that\nnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a company\nspokesman said.\n    American Express officials would not comment beyond a\nstatement made this morning. That statement, however, did not\nclose off the possibility of a public offering or other option\nfor Shearson.\n    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible\nShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes\nthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.\n    \"I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with\nthe money they have,\" he said.\n    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said\nAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.\n    In its statement, the financial services giant said it is\ncontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to\nthe investment by Nippon.\n    American Express said options under study range from\nexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition\nto broadening its access to capital.\n    American Express also said the options reflect the\ncontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'\nworldwide financial services strategy.\n    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a\nJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to\nSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.\n    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.\n    \"Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They\ndon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital\ngrowth,\" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other\nU.S. brokerage companies.\n    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are\ninterested in the expertise of American brokers. \"Those\n(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have\nthe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the\nmoney. That's a nice marriage,\" he said.\n    Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First\nBoston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group <EFH>\nrose 1-1/4 to 41-1/8, and PaineWebber Group <PWJ> climbed 7/8\nto 37-3/4. Merrill Lynch and Co, recommended today by a\nPaineWebber analyst, rose 2-5/8 to 45-3/8.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan package\nwill be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from\nboth creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous\nprocess of raising such jumbo loans, bankers said.\n    Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal\nhas been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared.\n    Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even\nnow, five months after the loan was agreed with a 13-bank\nadvisory committee on October 16, dozens of Mexico's some 400\ncreditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate.\n    The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact\nthat it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since\nthe region's debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will also\nsign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt.\n    Moreover, as the first major package built on U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker's strategy of offering loans to countries\nwilling to implement market-oriented, pro-growth policies,\nintense market scrutiny was only to be expected.\n    Still, the split within the banks' ranks came as a shock.\n\"This is not an unsuccessful operation, but we've had more\nbickering than ever,\" one senior banker commented.\n    Officers at small banks that have sold, swapped or or\nwritten down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why\nthey should throw good money after bad.\n    Major lenders counter that small banks must share the\nresponsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep\nreceiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones.\n    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said\nrecently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered\nthe entire Mexican package. Things have improved, but money\ncenter bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant\nbanks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached.\n    The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed. \"People who\nare outside shouldn't think they've been saved once we get over\n7.7 (billion dlrs),\" one warned.\n    But rounding up \"free-rider\" banks entails such a huge\ndrain on management resources that more and more bankers are\nacknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink.\n    One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of\ncurrent exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier \"base\"\ndate - August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamlining\nidea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans\nfor \"exit bonds\" that a debtor would issue at a discount.\n    Argentina has pressed for this solution, so far to no\navail, arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditors\naccount for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the\nnext 120 banks account only for a further six pct.\n    Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina\nmay not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it is\nseeking until September, which would be a year after\nnegotiations began with the International Monetary Fund.\n    The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of\ninvestors in Argentina, forcing up interest rates and spurring\ncapital flight, he said.\n    \"We have to introduce some common sense into the\ndiscussion,\" Machinea said this week in Cambridge, Mass.\n    He was echoed by Mexico's deputy planning minister, Pedro\nAspe Armella, who said the delay in signing his country's loan\nhas made it difficult to map economic policy with any\ncertainty. \"It's a sad affair,\" he told the Cambridge meeting.\n    Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in\nthe loan that it suspended its debt-equity swap program last\nmonth to put pressure on the banks. Other strains have\nintensified between U.S. and non-U.S. banks, partly because\nU.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns.\n    Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much on\nensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short\nterm, possibly to the detriment of longer-term solutions.\n    Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican\ndeal are American, some foreign bankers think other U.S. banks\nshould make up the difference.\n    This issue of \"national share\" was defused on the Mexican\ncommittee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with\nArgentina and Brazil, whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has\nalready suggested separate negotiations with regional\ncommittees of creditors.\n    Streamlining of the new-money process is running parallel\nwith efforts to develop a broader \"menu\" of alternatives to new\nloans, such as trade credits or debt-equity conversions.\n    \"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising\nnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank\nsyndications,\" Mulford said last week. He told the banks to\nstop complaining that there is no leeway in current procedures\nand to come up with ideas. Some steps have already been taken -\ninterest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banks\nare debating whether to accept partial interest payments from\nthe Philippines in paper instead of cash.\n    Because the banks want to isolate hard-line Brazil by\nclinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable, bankers\nsaid the Argentine package is likely to be along the\nestablished lines of the Baker Plan.\n    But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal,\nwhen it comes, will be radically different.\n    As such, the loan for Mexico could go down in the history\nbooks as the biggest but also the last jumbo. \"I'm convinced\nit'll be the last one in this form,\" one banker said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves\ntotal 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77\nbillion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased\nto 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's\nannual report said.\n    It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid\nreserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates\ncaused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This\naccounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision\nof 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision\noccurring in the United States, the report said.\n    Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its\nworldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last\nyear, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased\n298 billion cubic feet of reserves.\n    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these\ngains, the report said.\n    All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14\nmln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United\nStates, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to\nacquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.\n    Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions \"will be an\nintegral part of our strategy, should reserves become available\nat attractive prices.\"\n    The company said it expects \"the marketing climate for\nnatural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the\nopportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand\nimprove, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our\ninventory of attractive opportunities.\"\n    Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget\nof 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs\nlast year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. bank discount window borrowings\nless extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to\nWednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.\n    Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln\ndlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs.\nThe week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net\nborrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.\n    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on\nMarch 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net\nfree reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs\nfirst reported.\n    A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no\nlarge single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in\nthe first week of the latest bank statement period.\n    None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the\ndiscount window during the week and all of the Wednesday\nborrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a\nwhole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large\nregionals and the small banks.\n    Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday --\nfor which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason --\nto a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.\n    The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of\ntransportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting\nthat the weather was \"basically good\" for March, the spokesman\nsaid that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a\nday for the full week.\n    Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on\nWenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error\ncorrections in five districts.\n    As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He cited\nthe default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,\ncosting the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.\n    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing\ntwo of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr\nprovision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and\nseverance pay costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

William Gray (D-Pa.), the Budget Committee chairman,\ndecided earlier this week to use current government spending\nlevels as a starting point for the panel's deliberations.\n    In the past, the committee Democrats had always gone behind\nclosed doors to agree in advance on a draft budget plan.\n    But this year, the Democrats could not come to an\nagreement, prompting Gray to invite the Republicans to join\nthem in the drafting process in open session.\n    Republicans argued that this maneuver enabled the Democrats\nto avoid presenting alternatives to the president's budget.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It's now\nbasically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what\nthey want to do,\" the official said.\n    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the\nSoviet Union, he said, \"Shultz will not wage a vigorous\ncampaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but\nhe won't go to the President and voice his objections.\"\n    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks\nyesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat\nGrowers, the State Department said, \"Secretary Shultz expressed\nhis belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be\ncompetitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.\n    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to\ndetermine whether consideration should be given at this time to\nextending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement\nProgram.\"\n    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the\nSoviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to\nMoscow, the State Department official said.\n    \"Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a\nsubsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a\nfirm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.\"\n    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the\nUSSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized\nwheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.\n    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds\nthat the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring\nU.S. prices down to competitive levels.\n    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the\nState Department source said.\n    \"What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the\nlowest price being paid by anyone in the world,\" he said.\n    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the\nU.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.\n    Government and commodity sources also said there are\nelements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel\nAmstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.\n    \"Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a\nforegone conclusion,\" the State Department official said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Beginning 1990, they\nwere to receive semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate\nof 16 pct.\n    Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York, stems from the recent\nvoluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionally\ncreated an event of default on the notes. \n    The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each\n1,000 dlrs principal amount of debentures. The figure takes\ninto account the deep discount the holders received when they\nbought the issue.\n    Morgan Guaranty said there is about 30 mln dlrs principal\noutstanding.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But he said Inland has a \"serious\" capacity\nproblem.\n    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues\nare covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on\na new national accord are expected to begin in July.\n    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as\nsoon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a\nmember of the local's executive board.\n    The pact would also stay in place through the next national\ncontract, he said.\n    Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the\nnew accord. \"It's going to be close either way,\" he said.\n    Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is\nnot ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials\nsaid.

David Finch, an Australian who heads the IMF's exchange\nand trade relations department, told the IMF executive board on\nWednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next month\nafter 37 years with the agency.\n    The sources said that Finch, in a statement considered\nunprecedented, told the board that the United States had\nbrought undue pressure on the IMF to approve funding for Zaire\nand Egypt.\n    \"To resign in this manner is highly unusual, perhaps\nunprecedented,\" a monetary source said.\n    Neither Finch nor U.S. IMF Representative Charles Dallara\ncould be reached for comment.\n    The IMF, since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982,\nhas pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut back\non social spending as conditions to granting assistance.\n    The United States recently has been taking the position\nthat countries that take needed economic reform measures\nrelying more on market forces and private enterprise should be\nencouraged by assistance from the IMF and development banks.\n    Zaire, under the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko\nhas recently been taking many reform measures designed to heal\nits ailing economy.\n    The IMF last year approved a 22-month loan package for\nZaire totaling 270 mln dlrs.\n    The United States has been considering the possibility of\nseeking access to a military base in Zaire but no decision has\nbeen reached.\n    Egypt, for its part, has been holding talks with the IMF\naimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loan\npackage with the United States pressing for a quick deal,\naccording to the sources.\n    However, they said a tentative plan for Egypt that is\ncurrently being reviewed by the management of the Fund prior to\ngoing to the executive board for full approval has raised a\nnumber of questions about the country's ability to repay.\n    Egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of U.S.\nMiddle East policy.\n    The department headed by Finch, among other\nresponsibilties, makes certain that IMF policies and loan\nconditions are wielded evenly among countries.\n    Monetary sources have said that the United States had\nbrought pressure on the IMF to approve a loan package for\nMexico using economic conditions that have not been broadly\nused before, but Finch, according to the sources, made no\nreference to this.\n    Under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago by\nTreasury Secretary James Baker, the United States made the\ndecision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow out\nof their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures.\n     He also recommended that commercial banks provide 20\nbillion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while the\nmutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years.\n    A key part of the proposal gave the World Bank a much\ngreater role in dealing with the debt crisis, in part because\nof its familiarity with developing countries and their\nproblems.\n    The initiative, while widely heralded as a good first step\ntoward improving the the growing debt crisis, was viewed by\nsome at the IMF as a rebuke of previous austerity measures\ninsisted upon by the Fund in return for loans.\n \n REUTER\n\u0003",

The Fed is not going to shift\ngears at the present time or for at least another month,\" said\nMaria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    \"Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is\nnothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,\" added\nRobert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.\n    Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window\naveraged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank\nstatement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln\nand 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.\n    Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision\nin banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11\nto a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.\n    Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14\nmoney center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window\nfor the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing\nsplit between the large regional and the smaller banks.\n    While modest open market intervention was apparently enough\nto defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest\nstatement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have\nto be more aggressive in coming weeks.\n    The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly\non four of the five trading days via system and customer\nrepurchase agreements.\n    \"Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense\npressure,\" said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approaching\nmonth- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates\nin April.\n    \"The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding\nrequirement,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,\nwho expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon\npurchase in early April.\n    Economists were also heartened by further signs of a\ndeceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely\ndiscredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2\nand M-3 aggregates.\n    M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,\ncompared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly\nM-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.\n    \"The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we\nare on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures\nfor March,\" said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said\nthey could even come in below the bottom of their respective\ntarget ranges.\n    In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper\nlimit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.\n    Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on\ninflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some\neconomists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend\nsupport to calls for further accommodation here.\n    \"Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in\nrates before anything else,\" said Salomon's di Clemente, adding\nthat the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of\nthe U.S. economy.\n    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's\nhealth would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary\nto di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and\ninflation could lead to higher rates first.\n    Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding\nthat the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when\nFebruary's U.S. trade data are due for release.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It's in the waters where it's\nsupposed to be. It's been there for over a month.\"\n    The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay\nof the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area\nextending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.\n    With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the\nsouth and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to\nthe north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of\nthe strategic Straits of Hormuz.\n    The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm the\nexact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.\n    State Department officials cited concern about the safety\nof ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply\nrun to the Gulf.\n    Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulf\nand U.S. officials have said that Teheran has recently equipped\nitself with powerful Chinese and Italian-made anti-ship\nmissiles, posing a greater threat.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)\nwill be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)\nofficer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a\nspecial session of the pact's council.\n    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO\nsix monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an\nautumn London conference for another pact without economic\nclauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a\nGeneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic\nclauses, he said.\n    But delegates said the latter would only be considered if\nthe world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and\nthe European Community -- can resolve differences over how\nprices can best be supported and how to share the world\n    Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier\nindicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of\nthe ISO budget.\n    At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try\nand find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later\nthis year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO\n800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the\nU.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full\ncontribution in the last year of the current pact.\n    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO\nbudget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers\nand exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the\nimporter half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a\nsingle category of members who would all share the costs pro\nrata to their share of world sugar trade.\n    The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the\nnext full council session in the week of May 19.\n    There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The move has caused resentment and widespread\nindustrial unrest throughout the country.\n    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag\nPetrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on\nstrike in Belgrade.\n    Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communist\npolitical system and their role has traditionally not been to\ndefend workers from the government. The criticisms by the\nBelgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentment\nof the law than earlier reported.\n    The government has officially reported 70 strikes\nthroughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have\nindicated there have been more.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.\n    Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its\ninadequate facilities, including a single track rail line\nlinking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.\n    Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal\nfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser and\nsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can\nhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to\n200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.\n    Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since\n1979, official publications show. A container berth and two\ntimber and three general cargo berths will be added during the\ncurrent 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said.\n    \"The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995.\nBy 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help\nspur the economy, Miyazawa said.\n    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to\nthe controversial sales tax without any revision.\n    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks\nby a top government official as indicating a revision of the\ntax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The upper reaches of the\nYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many\nships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.\n    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across\nChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has\nrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average\nsince early February.\n    The New China News Agency said the average December\ntemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher\nthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.\n    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka\nand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of\nPlantation Industries officials told Reuters\n    In Australia, concern is growing about below-average\nrainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the\nQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local\nMeteorological Bureau officials said.\n    For many farmers and government officials the fear is that\nwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major\nthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the\nwheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.\n    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought\nwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the\noccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as\nEl Nino, they said.\n    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the\nAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single\ncause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.\n    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for\nagriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'\nwas unique.\n    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and\nthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last\nmajor event in 1982/83, it said.\n    El Nino, Spanish for \"Christ Child\" because it appears around\nChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds\nand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast\nof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with\nthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade\nwinds, meteorologists said.\n    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's \"pump\" effect, raise the\nsea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.\n    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends\na surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it\ncollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.\n    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the\nrain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the\nPacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.\n    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather\nsaid.\n    China, where the affected areas have received between 40\nand 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the\nMay-September rains, it said.\n    The May-September rains normally provide the\ndrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.\n    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have\nreceived less than half the normal rainfall during the current\nwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing\nas the rainy season draws to an end.\n    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be\nat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually\noccur between April and June, although it is not possible at\nthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

If they can get\nthe financing and refinancing that's necessary, they may be\nable to make their economies grow again.\"\n    Asked whether he expected other nations to follow the path\ntaken by Brazil and Ecuador, he said the two countries were\nspecial cases.

The\ncommittee's chairman is Peng Zhen, considered one of the more\nconservative figures in the Chinese leadership.\n    The \"factory director responsibility system\" covered by the\ndraft law has already been experimentally introduced in state\nfirms over the last three years, giving managers greater\nfreedom from the control of factory party committees.\n    Diplomats said the agenda decision appeared to contradict\nassurances by top leader Deng Xiaoping that reforms were not\nthreatened by the current campaign against \"bourgeois\nliberalisation,\" or western political ideas.\n    Earlier this week Deng raised expectations for the session\nby saying plans to reform China's political structure would be\nunveiled in 1987, diplomats said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Two World Bank review teams are in the\nPhilippines to assess government requests for funding for an\nexpanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program,\nbank officials said.\n    They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for\n100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.\n    The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr\nlong-term loan from a World Bank-led consultative group of\nmultilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its\nland reform program.\n    The officials said negotiations will start next month on\nanother 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms\nin 14 major state-owned corporations.\n    On Tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310\nmln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program.\n    The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans\nto finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.\n    World Bank sources said the bank's lending to the\nPhilippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3\nbillion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100\nloans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.\n    The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs\nin loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three\nyears of President Ferdinand Marcos's rule. Marcos was toppled\nby a military-civilian revolt in February 1986.\n    \"The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for\naid were not implemented properly,\" they said.\n    The sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used\nto rehabilitate the state-owned Development Bank of the\nPhilippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which\nare saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.\n    \"At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were\nsupposed to go to the DBP,\" the World Bank sources said. \"Over\nthe past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to the\nPhilippines almost completely dried up.\"\n    In 1986 alone, the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in\nloan repayments, about 59 pct of the government's budget\ndeficit of 27 billion pesos for the year, they said.\n    Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last\nSeptember when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. The\nsources said the loan was held up because of delays by the\ngovernment in submitting essential documents.\n    The World Bank sources said the request for land reform\nfunding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bank-led\nconsultative group to be held alongside the April 27-29 annual\nmeeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Osaka.\n    The government has said the land reform plan aims to\ndistribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants.\n    The sources said the Philippine government estimated the\nentire program would cost 60 billion pesos. \"About 27 billion is\nlong-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by\nlandowners,\" they said. \"The landowners will be paid in 10-year\nbonds redeemable in ten instalments.\"\n    The sources said the bulk of financing would cover\ndevelopment costs for the land program and help to bridge the\ngap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and a\nproposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.\n    \"If you include interest, the total amount of external\nassistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs,\" the\nsources said. \"That volume of aid does not appear difficult.\"\n    They said Japan, the World Bank and the ADB are expected to\nprovide most of the financing while the Philippines' 12\nbilateral aid donors would contribute the rest.\n    The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines is\ndesigned to support its balance of payments position while the\ngovernment aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross\nnational product growth.\n    \"Brazil did not do this homework,\" one said. \"They pushed\nahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for\ntheir balance of payments position. Manila is being more\ncautious and aims at soft borrowings which, it is hoped, will\nbe outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in\nthe country emerging from debt in five or six years.\"\n    Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The remainder is held by\nindustry.\n    A company statement said SAS would wait to see the outcome\nof the government-to-government negotiations with the United\nStates, in which the three Scandinavian countries have demanded\ngreater access to the U.S. Domestic market for SAS in exchange\nfor deregulating prices across the North Atlantic.\n    At present SAS is allowed to fly to New York, Chicago, Los\nAngeles, Seattle and Anchorage.\n    SAS gave no details of the Airbus Industrie counter-offer\nfor its long-range A340, but said it will study the bid\nfurther.\n    Swissair yesterday confirmed an order for the MD-11 long\nhaul jets worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs and said it had\npreferred the McDonnell Douglas planes over the A340, a project\nthat has not yet been formally launched, as it met the\nairline's requirements better and would be able to enter\nservice in 1990.\n    SAS President Jan Carlzon announced the MD-11 order last\nDecember, saying the plane would replace the airline's current\nfleet of DC10s. The first of the MD-11s was to be delivered in\n1991 for use mainly on its intercontinental routes.\n    In January, SAS officials said Airbus had made a revised\noffer that included larger, more powerful engines and two\nversions of the four-engine plane. One would seat 220\npassengers and another 260 against the MD-11's 265-seat\ncapacity.\n    The offer was part of a drive to secure at least five\nairline customers for the new aircraft to enable Airbus\nIndustrie to launch production. Airbus is expected to decide\nwhether to go ahead with the project next month.\n    SAS officials earlier said they did not expect the first\nA340 to be delivered before 1992. McDonnell Douglas had given\nSAS until March 31 to agree to final terms for the MD-11 deal.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The death of the world's tropical rain\nforests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and\nbiological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with\nthe International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said.\n    At stake is the ability of developing nations, including\nBrazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and\nthe loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in\nimportant sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they\nsaid.\n    The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of\nconsumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem\nis already acute.\n    The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic\ndangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest\nis not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a\nPhilippine government consultant on environmental impact.\n    \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,\nnow we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable\nlogging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging\nforeign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said.\n    About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that\nare now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops.\n    Government security advisers say that as a direct result,\nthe most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in\nthe upland areas, said Ganapin.\n    Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods\nhave less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known\nway to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within.\n    \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy\nHafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation.\n    Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next\ntwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded\nland in the Philippines.\n    The experts say that without a major initiative from the\ndevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue with\ncountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts\nat the cost of long-term insolvency.\n    Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not\nnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,\nand nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said\nPeter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director.\n    There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end\nproducts of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a\nyear, he said.\n    U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that\n25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients\nto higher plants growing in the forests.\n    Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further\ndiscoveries and force major corporations to research, develop\nand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists\nsay is incalculable.\n    By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be\nexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings\nwill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two\nbillion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said.\n    Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,\nInter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84,\nonly 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.\n    WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests\nhave vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,\nup to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging\npractises and by local farmers.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The amount is currently 30 mln yen.\n    The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum\nperiod of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one month\nfrom the current three months, the sources said.\n    The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of\ncertificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years from\nthe current one month to one year, the sources said.\n    They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce a\nshift of funds from bank to other financial instruments.\n    One official of a major bank said the planned moves were\nunexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously\nexpected to have ended with the measures to start in April.\n    On April 6, the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum\ntime deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and\ncut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Mortgage lending has fallen steadily since last\nJuly's peak of 3.9 billion stg.\n    Net new mortgage commitments however rose to 2.5 billion\nstg from January's 1.9 billion, bringing the total commitments\noutstanding to 6.9 billion after January's 6.6 billion stg.\n    Wholesale funding rose to 292 mln stg after January's 29\nmln, but was still below each of the last six 1986 months.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazil's hard-line debt stance, though\nmeeting creditor resistance, is boosting political initiatives\nin Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy,\nregional debt officials and economic analysts say.\n    \"Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannot\npay, under present conditions, without sacrificing growth,\"\nPeruvian President Alan Garcia said, referring to Brazil.\n    And, as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual\nmeeting at the Inter-American Development Bank in Miami next\nweek, the region's debt crisis is clearly coming to a head.\n    Around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been\nrescheduled since 1983, with interest rate margins now below\none pct, multi-year accords a norm and no financial crash in\nsight, but a lasting solution seems no nearer.\n    Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazil's\nsuspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of private\nbank debt last month, though prospects of a chain default are\nstill remote.\n    Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and others rejected such action\nand Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said,\n\"Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary.\"\n    But Brazil's action has had an impact on other debt\nnegotiations, speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela last\nmonth and influencing current talks with Argentina.\n    Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts,\nwith the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest relief\nand Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following\na serious earthquake.\n    Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending\nand accept innovative repayment schemes, not only by debtors\nbut also by official agencies which have stepped up their own\ncredit flows as part of the U.S.-inspired plan.\n    One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil and\nEcuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to\nlink debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as\nexport earnings, GDP or raw materials prices.\n    Despite this, debtor countries continue to accept the\ncase-by-case approach, and Cuba's call for a joint negotiating\nfront is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru,\nthe region's flag-bearer in unilateral payment decisions.\n    \"Each nation must negotiate its debt independently,\naccording to its own needs,\" Brazilian foreign minister Ramiro\nde Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend.\n    Venezuela's rapid agreement with its creditors, soon after\nBrazil's move, had been seen by the political opposition as a\nbetrayal of debtor solidarity, but de Abreu praised the\nVenezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal.\n    Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica and others are also pursuing\nnormal negotiations with creditor banks, while at the same time\npressing hard for better terms, particularly lower interest\nrate spreads. Latin American officials say that while the debt\nshould be negotiated case-by-case, their governments are\npromoting a general framework for talks based on growth and\ndevelopment priorities, lower interest payments and new\nfinancing.\n    \"The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodox\nsolutions to debt cases don't work,\" said a senior Peruvian\ngovernment official responsible for debt affairs.\n    He saw a growing likelihood that other countries would\nfollow Peru's action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit in\nthe face of trade and other factors beyond debtors' control\nsuch as minimal bank lending.\n    These factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr net\noutflow from Latin America in the last five years, and\nBrazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paid\nback 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billion\nin loans.\n    Latin American debtors feel they have complied with their\nside of the bargain, slashing public spending, devaluing\ncurrencies, cutting inflation, privatizing state enterprises\nand introducing debt equity schemes.\n    Brazil, as the region's biggest debtor and its most\ndiversified economy, has now apparently adopted the principle\nthat a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more\nserious crisis later on.\n    \"We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be\none of continuous crisis,\" Funaro told a conference in Rio de\nJaneiro this week.\nbillion dlr debt burden this year are slim, with coffee prices\nplunging, oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels and\ninterest rates beginning to rise.\n Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to\nthree pct projected earlier, and inflation near 80 pct after\n105 pct last year.\n    Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after\neight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected trade\nsurplus, while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct.\n    Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe the\npayment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the\nregional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations, a\nview echoed by senior international bank officials.\n    Some banks, including Citibank, Morgan Guaranty and Bank of\nAmerica are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans.\n    Brazil's refusal to accept an IMF program, a condition set\nby many banks for new lending, meanwhile reflects the view of\nmost Latin American governments that equate the Fund with\nrecession. But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries in\nthe region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The\nrecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> to take over Hero\nConserven Lenzburg <HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961\npledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone\nwho was not eligible according to the company's statutes.\n    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not\ncarry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of\ngreater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.\n    \"People buying, for example, more than five pct of a\ncompany's shares should be made to declare their purchase,\" he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Economists' forecasts vary widely for\nthe February monthly U.S. budget deficit to be released today.\nHowever most agree on one point -- that the budget deficit for\nthe 1987 fiscal year will narrow substantially from 1986\nlevels.\n    The report is likely to mean very little to the moribund\ncredit markets, however, which have been stilled by a stable\ndollar and perceptions of steady Federal Reserve policy.\n    Economists said that a leaner federal budget could help the\ncredit markets if it lowers the Treasury's financing needs and\nresults in lower interest rates, but investors may not respond\nuntil they see evidence that this is taking place.\n    Economists' forecasts for the February deficit range from\n20 billion dlrs to nearly 30 billion dlrs, with most forecasts\nclustered in the 26-28 billion dlrs range. This compares with a\ndeficit of 24.6 billion dlrs in February 1986.\n    In January, the budget deficit was 2.1 billion dlrs,\nleaving the fiscal year-to-date deficit at 65.6 billion dlrs.\n    Most economists expect the 1987 fiscal deficit to fall to\n180-190 billion dlrs from 220.7 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986.\n    Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette\nSecurities Corp, expects a 26.3 billion dlr February budget\ndeficit, and a 186.5 billion dlr fiscal 1987 deficit.\n    Stephansen expects widening in the February deficit\nrelative to last year based on two developments.\n    First, total revenues showed a slowdown in their yearly\ngrowth rate relative to prior months' growth rates, she said,\nas corporate and individual tax payments net of tax refund\npayments appear to have been weak in February.\n    \"The second factor... is relatively strong outlay\nperformance,\" Stephansen wrote in a weekly report. \"Data\navailable to date suggest that their year-over-year growth is\nclose to 4.3 pct, well above the 0.5 pct average that prevailed\nin the last four months of the fiscal year.\"\n    Joe Liro of S.G. Warburg Securities and Co expects the\nFebruary budget deficit to total 26-28 billion dlrs and the\nfiscal 1987 deficit to be 190 billion dlrs.\n    He said that as a result of the change in the 1987 tax code\nand the new structure for determining withholding of personal\nincome tax payments, the Treasury is receiving less tax\nreceipts than it received at this time last year.\n    \"The Administration compounded a tricky situation by saying\nhow difficult it is to fill out the new W-4 tax forms he said.\n\"The wage earner was underwithholding at the beginning of the\nyear and continues to be underwithheld.\"\n    By contrast, Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government\nSecurities Inc said that many taxpayers have probably delayed\nfilling out the new tax withholding forms, so that this has not\nbeen a drag on tax receipts as others have argued.\n    \"The first half of the year brought strong tax receipts\nfrom capital gains and the repeal of the investment tax credit,\nwhich is expected to contribute a substantial portion of the\ncorporate taxes to be paid this week,\" he said in the firm's\nweekly credit market memo.\n    He forecast a February budget deficit of 20 billion dlrs,\nand a fiscal 1987 deficit of 180 billion dlrs.\n    In March, McCarthy expects to see a deficit of 23 to 24\nbillion dlrs compared with 30 billion dlrs in March 1986.\n    But economists agreed that the federal budget deficit is\nfar from occupying center stage in the credit market's focus\nand is unlikely to have an impact now regardless of its size.\n    Yesterday, the key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 closed\nunchanged at 99-28/32 to yield 7.51 pct after trading in a\nnarrow range throughout the session.\n    Fed funds traded from six pct to 6-1/8 pct yesterday, up\nslightly from Wednesday's 5.97 pct average, and are expected to\nopen within that range today.\n  \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "President Reagan, staying cool under\na televised grilling on the Iran-contra scandal, insisted he\nhas told all he knows about the crippling affair and said he\nwould do it all differently given a second chance.\n    \"No, I would not go down that same road again,\" the president\nsaid last night during a 32-minute news conference, his first\nin exactly four months, when asked if he would again sell arms\nto Iran in hopes of freeing U.S. hostages in the Middle East.\n    But he added, \"I'll keep my eye open for an opportunity\nagain for improving relations. And we will continue to explore\nevery legitimate means for getting our hostages back.\"\n    As expected, the televised conference was almost completely\ndominated by questions about the secret sales of U.S. arms to\nIran and the diversion of funds to \"contra\" rebels in Nicaragua.\n    From an investigators' standpoint, the toughest question\nconcerned 76-year-old Reagan's knowledge of the contra\noperation.\n    As expected, the president repeatedly stated -- now calmly,\nnow with some fire -- that he knew nothing about that\nscheme, said to have been run by White House National Security\naide Oliver North, since fired, with the knowledge of\npresidential adviser John Poindexter, now resigned.\n    \"No, that is not true at all,\" the president replied sternly\nwhen asked about a report Poindexter had told him, twice, about\nthe secret channeling of millions of dollars to the contras.\n    \"When I went on the air right after the news broke (about\nIran arms deal last November), I did not know at that time\nthere was any money involved.\"\n    He said he learned of the contra diversion -- which may\nhave broken U.S. laws and will be the top priority of\ncongressional investigative hearings on this affair -- only\nwhen Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese told him on November 25.\n    Just as important from Reagan's standpoint, however, was\nthe manner in which he handled his first non-scripted public\naccounting of the scandal since the details first began leaking\nout last November and plunged his administration into deep\npolitical crisis.\n    He appeared to bring it off without major stumbles, abetted\nby a press corps that seemed at pains to maintain a civil\nmanner until the very end when it crowded round him trying to\nget in one last question as he was leaving the rostrum in the\nWhite House East Room.\n    He often responded slowly and deliberately but never seemed\nat a loss for words, or vintage Reagan mannerisms.\n    At one point in the contra discussion he furrowed his brow\nin puzzlement as he said he was just as mystified as everyone\nabout where all the unaccounted millions had gone from the Iran\narms sales of 1985 and 1986.\n    \"I'm still wanting to find out the source of all the extra\nmoney, the bank accounts and where that extra money went,\" he\nsaid.\n    At another point, he laughed off a question on whether he\nmight have been told about the contra connection and forgotten,\nsaying, \"Oh, no,\" pausing to chuckle and adding:\n    \"You'd have heard me without opening the door to my office\nif I'd been told that.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan's economic policies face fierce\ninternational attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its\ntrade surplus, international monetary sources said.\n    At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government\nofficials from major nations are considering an Organisation\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report\nthat forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they\nsaid.\n    Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the\nyen's sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge\nwhen growth picks up, according to the OECD.\n    As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect\nits export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports\nby adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.\n    That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret\nmeetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board.\n    The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized\nwhen the board met to consider the country's economy under the\nannual consultations it holds with each of its members.\n    The United States, which until recently has been reluctant\nto criticize Japan's fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he\nsaid.\n    The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese\ngovernment's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal\nyear beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including\nthe IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below\nthree pct, monetary sources said.\n    The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to\nsuch criticism because it is already under mounting domestic\npressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. The\nyen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge\nAmerican market.\n    Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further\nyen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last\nyear amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.\n    Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign\nMinister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here\ntoday at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians,\nincluding Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping\nthe yen will weaken, government officials said.\n    At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France,\nJapan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate\nto hold currencies at around current levels.\n    Officials said that wording represented a compromise.\nMiyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few\nmonths, before it weakens later in the year.\n    Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value\nfor the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word \"recent\" for\n\"current,\" while the United States wanted it to more clearly\npoint to the dollar's weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the\nword \"present,\" they said.\n    In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the\ndollar dropped some 10 yen.\n    The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the\nmarket that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from\nrising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for\nthe U.S. Currency.\n    Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do\nnot take account of the structural changes in the Japanese\neconomy that will be triggered by the strong yen.\n    Officials said there are already signs of that.

        "body": "Geodome Resources Ltd said\nfollowing receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's\n<RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction\nand pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer\nCounty, Idaho, as quickly as possible.\n    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of\n3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It\nsaid the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per\nyear, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three\nyears for a rapid payback of capital costs.\n    The company said the feasibility study calls for gold\nproduction averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the\nmine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with\n99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune\nlife.\n    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment\nand 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. \nIt said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the\nassociated mill by Geodome.\n    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not\nincluded in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine\nholes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of\ngold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are\nreserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be\nmilled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility\nstudy used a 350 dlr gold price.\n    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201\ndlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the\nfirst three years, in constant dollars.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

An opposition boycott over a\nproposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.\n    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro\nNakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.\n    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or\nearly May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.\n    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary\nconferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in\nearly April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on\nthe matter, taking into account parliament debate.\n    The package is likely to include a record amount of public\nworks spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.\n    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800\nbillion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion\nfor public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help\nspur the economy, Miyazawa said.\n    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to\nthe controversial sales tax without any revision.\n    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks\nby a top government official as indicating a revision of the\ntax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The study has not been\nofficially released due to objections from some countries.\n    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the\nrelease of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.\nOECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting\nin mid-May.\n    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was\nbased on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped\nsharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,\nand foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.\n    \"The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does\nnot take account of various differences in farming conditions\nin each country, such as geography,\" the source said.\n    He said it is highly likely that the final study will show\nJapan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.\n    \"This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm\nmarket further, but this would have little impact on Japan's\nagriculture policy,\" he said, without giving further details.\n    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies\nby major exporting nations like the United States and the\nEuropean Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

John Maslen, head of the EC\ndelegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session:\n\"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.\"\n    Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team\nhad refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which\nwould recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.\n    Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements\nsigned by the Community must contain this territorial clause\nstipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC\nnegotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: \"We wanted\nthe territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.\"\n    A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was\nmade towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be\nnecessary to complete the work.\n    Any decision in principle to set up relations would require\napproval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the\nexecutive committee of Comecon.\n    Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the\nEast bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: \"We\nhave narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not\non all questions.\"\n    Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any\njoint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the\nCommunity, he replied: \"This question is not contained in the\ndraft which our side presented.\"\n    West German diplomats said they would insist on including\nthe clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.\n    The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading\nblocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks\nbetween the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic\nrelations in January.\n    The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite\nnon-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five\nbillion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half\nthe deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of\nSoviet oil imported by the EC.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It plans\non filing a rate application with the Public Utilities\nCommission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.\n    It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the\ninvestors because they could take quicker advantage of tax\nbenefits than the utility could.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Geodome Resources Ltd said\nfollowing receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's\nStearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and\npre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County,\nIdaho, as quickly as possible.\n    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of\n3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It\nsaid the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per\nyear, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three\nyears for a rapid payback of capital costs.\n    It said the feasibility study calls for gold production\naveraging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and\n50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000\nounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life.\n    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment\nand 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm\nsaid. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner\nbut the associated mill by Geodome.\n    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not\nincluded in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine\nholes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of\ngold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.\n    Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade\nmaterial that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for\ngold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.\n    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201\ndlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the\nfirst three years, in constant dollars.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

And a fall as proportion of GDP.\"\n    Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account\ndeficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures\nshowed an encouraging trend.\n    Keating said the government would maintain responsible\neconomic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an\nelection, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's\n80 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    \"We have to build the import competing sector back,\" he said.\n\"We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are\ntrying to rebuild the culture of productivity and\nmanufacturing.\"\n    Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy\nhad been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and\ncontinued with wage restraint and deregulation.\n    The Government would follow with spending cuts in its\neconomic statement on May 14, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Morgan Guaranty Ltd, through a special\nfinancing subsidiary, said it is issuing the first repackaging\nof perpetual floating rate notes, consisting of a repackaging\nof an outstanding WestPac Banking Corp security.\n    Trading in perpetual floating rate notes, about 17 billion\ndlrs of which are outstanding, has come to a virtual halt as\nprices plunged. Because the securities never mature, there is\nno way to price them properly unless there is a liquid two-way\nmarket for them.\n    Investors have been stuck with billions of dollars of notes\non their books that no one else will buy.\n    Under terms of the offer, Morgan said it has set up a\nspecial-purpose financing company, Pacific Securities Co Ltd,\nwhich will issue two separate securities. The unit becomes the\nholder of 200 mln dlrs of Westpac floating rate notes.\n    Morgan officials declined to disclose the level at which\nPacific  purchased the Westpac securities, although in late\nFebruary, they were quoted at 85 against an issue price of par.\n    Pacific Securities will issue two instruments. The first is\na floating rate bond due March 29, 2002. The bond pays interest\nat 50 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.\n    While the initial Westpac issue offered investors only 15\nbasis points over LIBOR, Morgan Guaranty said WestPac has\nagreed with Pacific Securities that it will pay investors the\nremaining 35 basis points.\n    Also, WestPac has agreed to redeem to floating rate notes\nafter 15 years.\n    The other portion of the security consists of a zero-coupon\nbond, also maturing at 2002, for which the investor pays 20\ncents on the dollar. Morgan officials said that by 2002, the\neffective yield will be a 20 pct return.\n    However, Morgan officials said, holders of the zero-coupon\nbonds will not be paid in cash when the securities mature.\n    Instead, they will be paid in an equivalent amount of\nzero-coupon Westpac perpetual floating rate notes.\n    As part of the agreement, Pacific Securities has agreed to\nplace proceeds of the sale of the new securities on deposit at\nWestPac and earnings from the deposit will be used to subsidise\nthe payment of the additional interest to investors.\n    Also as part of the issue, there is an option for issuance\nof a 70 mln dlr tap to be offered the following year.\n    The tap will consist of 70 mln dlrs in floating rate notes\npaying and an additional equivalent amount of zero coupon bonds\nalso at a deep discount of 20 cents on the dollar.\n    Fees consist of a one pct selling concession and 0.50 pct\ncombined underwriting and management.\n    Westpac itself has agreed to be co-lead manager of both\ntranches and two small syndicates are being formed, Morgan\nGuaranty said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now\nintroduced if the limit is exceeded.\n    Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary\ndepartment said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy\non the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.\n    \"We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the\nfirst, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we\nwill issue at least a few times a week,\" Korkman told Reuters.\n    He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a\nthree-month maturity at first as the market was best developed\nfor paper of that maturity.\n    The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month\ncredits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank\nand the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional\novernight call money market.\n    Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around\nnine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,\nwhile three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.\n    On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade\nin banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka.

        "body": "Mexican officials and representatives\nof about 360 creditor banks worldwide started to sign\nagreements for 7.7 billion dlrs in new loans, Citibank said as\nco-chairman of Mexico's bank advisory committee.\n    The package, which was agreed in principle with the\ncommittee last October 16, is built on a core loan of six\nbillion dlrs, of which five billion dlrs will be lent for 12\nyears with five years' grace.\n    The remaining one billion dlrs is in the form of a\nco-financing with the World Bank, which will guarantee 500 mln\ndlrs. This loan is for 15 years with nine years' grace.\n    The package also includes two contingency facilities\ntotalling 1.7 billion dlrs.\n    One is a growth-contingency co-financing with the World\nBank for 500 mln dlrs, of which half will be guaranteed by the\nWorld Bank.\n    The loan may be drawn to fund high-priority investment\nprojects if Mexican economic growth fails to reach certain\ngrowth targets for the first quarter of 1987.\n    Disbursements would be for 12 years with seven years'\ngrace. Bankers said they expect the loan, which is available\nuntil March 1988, will be drawn down.    \n    The second contingency facility, for 1.2 billion dlrs, is\ndesigned to support investment in the public and private\nsectors.\n    The loan may be drawn down until April 1988 but only if\nMexico experiences a shortfall in public-sector external\nreceipts and provided that Mexico first qualifies for drawings\nunder a 600 mln sdr oil-contigency facility from the\nInternational Monetary Fund.\n    This IMF loan would be triggered if the price of oil falls\nbelow nine dlrs a barrel for three months.\n    Because of the level of public sector external receipts in\nthe fourth quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987,\nMexico will not draw the first two tranches of the continency\nfacility, totalling 451 mln dlrs, Citibank said.\n    As previously reported, bank commitments to the new money\npackage will also be reduced by 250 mln dlrs, representing the\ninterest payments that Mexico will save this year, thanks to\nthe reduced spread on the rescheduling.\n    Under the rescheduling, Mexico is restructuring 43.7\nbillion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt over 20 years with\nseven years' grace.\n    Maturities on another 8.6 billion dlrs of loans granted in\n1983 and 1984 will remain the same. The interest rate will be\nat 13/16 pct over Eurodollar deposit rates - the margin that\napplies to the entire package.\n    Rounding out the deal, the banks have agreed to prolong six\nbillion dlrs of trade lines and to refinance some 10 billion\ndlrs of private-sector debt that comes under the Mexican\ngovernment's exchange-guarantee scheme, Ficorca.\n    The size of the package thus comes to about 76 billion\ndlrs, the largest ever assembled in the international credit\nmarkets, Citibank said.\n    The loan is still only 99 pct subscribed and the loan books\nwill be kept open for several more weeks to round up the final\n100 mln dlrs and the approximately 60 banks that have so far\nrefused to join the deal.\n \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Credits made by foreign companies or banks to\nsubsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be\nexcluded from the conditions.\n    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in\ntheir statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding\nfive pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged\ntreatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.\n    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of\nItaly can exercise supervisory controls when information on a\nbank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a\ncompany or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or\nindirectly.\n    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held\nis below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.\n    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value\nof the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two\npredefined limits.\n    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the\ntotal assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The center is expected to\nput up 15 mln dlrs of the cost while GE contributes equipment\nand services valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, New York State contributes\n1.1 mln dlrs and Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC> adding 1.0 mln\ndlrs.\n    Rather than using the conventional gas turbine fuels,\ndistillate oil or natural gas, GE said, the program will look\nat the feasability of powering a turbine with coal/water slurry\n-- a mixture of water and finely ground coal particles from\nwhich most of the ash has been removed.\n    Besides using a cheaper fuel, the company said, such a\nsystem would also be less expensive to build than conventional\ncoal plants which require a boiler in which coal heats water to\nmake steam to drive a turbine or a coal gasifier which converts\nto coal into gas, which is then burned to power a turbine.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "First City Bancorporation's sale of 54\nmln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly\nreduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are still\nvirtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.\n    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so\nFirst City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman\nJames Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more\nof the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans\nto raise cash.\n    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and\nto oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had\nalready been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a\nloss, but he could not identify how many were included in those\ncategories.\n    The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy\nGrowth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90\nmln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.\n    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn\nin oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986\nand has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other\ncapital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming\nassets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln\ndlrs at the end of 1985\n    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in\nthe troubled bank unless government assistance is available.\n    \"Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a\nsubstantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of\nitself won't make the company look better to a potential\nbuyer,\" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,\nCrisanti and Maffei Inc.\n    \"It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54\nmln dlrs is a substantial amount,\" Archibold said, \"but the\ndeal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.\"\n    Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about\n14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or\nsuppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by\nits past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and\ngas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late\n1970s and early 1980s.\n    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential\ncame from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to\nloan money to \"more venturesome\" oil borrowers that promised a\nhigher potential return. The other half of the loans were from\nFirst City's lead bank in Houston.\n    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said\nthe sale of the package of energy loans was the first\nencouraging news from First City in months.\n    \"It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but\nit's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them\nto sell additional loans,\" Kotowski said. \"Prudential can fund\nthese things more cheaply than First City and there's an\nincentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as\nvalues are depressed\"\n    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the\nbank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to\ntotal loans. \"This move, which we believe is the first\ntransaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to\nmake it without suffering a loss.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Food and Drug Administration has\napproved Burroughs Wellcome Co's AZT as a treatment to help\ncertain AIDS patients, including those with advanced-AIDS\nrelated complex.\n    The drug is the first approved treatment for AIDS in the\nU.S. AZT or azidothymidine will be marketed as Retrovir by the\ncompany, the U.S. arm of Britain's <Wellcome PLC>.\n    Because of its limited supply, the FDA said the drug will\nbe restricted initially to those patients with AIDS or\nAIDS-related complex with severely depressed immunity or a\nhistory of Pnumocystis carinii, pneumonia.\n    \"Today's approval marks an important step but by no means a\nfinal victory against our ongoing war against AIDS,\" said Dr\nRobert E. Windom, assistant secretary for health at the Public\nHealth Service.\n    He noted that available clinical data were sufficient for\napproving the use of Retrovir only for certain indications and\nnot for all AIDS associated conditions.\n    Nevertheless, Windom said today's action means that\nsignificant medical relief will be available to thousands of\nthose afflicted with the disease.\n    \"Retrovir is not a cure but it has demonstrated ability to\nimprove the short-term survival of AIDS patients with recently\ndiagnosed PCP (Pneumomystis carinii pneumonia) and certain\npatients with advanced ARC (AIDS-related complex),\" said\nWindom.\n    Advanced AIDS related complex is a condition that\nfrequently precedes and develops within a short time into\nfull-scale acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\n    As of March 16, there were 32,825 AIDS cases reported\nnationwide, with more than 16,000 deaths.\n    The Public Health Agency said advanced ARC patients have\nsymptoms that include weight loss, persistent fever and\ndiarrhea, and less severe infections such as oral thrush and\nherpes infections.\n    The federal agency said that AIDS patients who are expected\nto qualify for retrovir treatment are those who have serious\nopportunistic infections associated with AIDS and those with\nadvanced AIDS related complex.\n    It is estimated that about two to three times as many\nAmericans may suffer from advanced ARC as from AIDS.\n    Burroughs Wellcome, of Research Triangle Park, N.C., has\nscheduled a press conference for Monday in New York where it\nwill discuss what patients will quality for treatment. The\ncompany has said that a year's treatment with the drug would\ncost 8,000 dlrs to 10,000 dlrs.\n    Burroughs has also said that it has adequate supplies of\nthe drug for the most seriously ill patients, and will have\nsupplies for a minimum of 30,000 patients and probably more by\nthe end of the year.\n    Retrovir's approval was expected as a panel of expert\nmedical advisers to the FDA recommended in January that the\ndrug be licensed for sale even though there were gaps in\nunderstanding the drug's effectiveness.\n    The panel said the drug could prolong the lives of certain\nAIDS patients but it also caused severe side effects such as\nanemia and other blood problems.\n    Due to the extraordinary situation surrounding AIDS, a\nfatal disease reaching what some health officials say is\nepidemic proportions, Windom said the FDA has moved in near\nrecord time--four months--to approve the drug.\n    AZT, derived from herring sperm, was created in the 1960s\nby Jerome P. Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as an\nanticancer agent.\n    Meanwhile in London, dealers said Wellcome shares rose to\n497p in response, up from last night's close of 457p.\n    But pharmaceutical analyst Mark Clark of Barclays de Zoete\nWedd said the new drug's share of the market may not be as a\nhigh as expected since it had very severe side effects.\n    \"It is not a cure and the side effects are so bad it is\nunlikely that someone could support a full year's treatment,\" he\nsaid. \"There are also a whole host of other drugs likely to come\nonto the market quite soon.\"\n    Last week the drug was approved for marketing in the U.K.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Futures on\ncurrency swaps would not require capital allocation.\n    A futures market in Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (Ginnie Mae) repos would help investors outside the\ncircle of primary dealers get the best possible price, Dew\nsaid.\n    Dew emphasized that the COMEX board had not yet considered\nthe contracts.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The ministry has also suggested that foreign\nshareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.\n    In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met\nFumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange\nthe merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.\n    At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre\noptic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its\nglobal network.\n    \"C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as\napplication and other procedures,\" said Watanabe, who is also\nchairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese\nside is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left\nwith the new firm, after the merger.\n    \"These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration\nof Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we\nare not a colony or something,\" said Watanabe.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "West Germany's money supply growth\nslowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is\nstill definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.\n    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only\nmoderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with\nstatutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,\nshort-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually\nstrongly in January.\n    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings\nof German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted\nannual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.\n    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.\n    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time\ndeposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally\nadjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash\nand sight deposits, rose seven pct.\n    International transactions of non-banks again led to a\nsignificant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.\n    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against\nforeigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1\nbillion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.\n    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the\ninflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary\neffect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.\n    Outstanding bank credits to companies and private\nindividuals remained virtually unchanged in February.\n    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected\nthe foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in\nlong-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.\n    At the end of February total bank credits to the private\nsector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.\n    The effect of public authority cash movements on the money\nsupply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.\n    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority\npaper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial\nbanks and the Bundesbank.\n    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money\nsupply growth to a larger extent than in January.\n    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed\nwith banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not\nhave the same possibilities for defending themselves before the\nITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.\n    \"Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable\nthan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods\nproduced in the United States,\" it said in a statement.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department\nofficial, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting\ncountries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S.\ndemand for imports is expected to fall.\n    \"They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade\nsurplus falls,\" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten\nsaid.\n    Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169\nbillion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for\nthe next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct\ndecline since September 1985.\n    The government should intervene to push the dollar down\nfurther if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement\nin the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced\nand if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.\n    Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for\nthe huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The\nParis agreement between the major industrialized countries\nprovided only for a pause in its decline, he said.\n    Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty\nTrust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of\nlagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency\nmisalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and\nunbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.\n    John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested\nforeign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from\nthe U.S. trade deficit fall.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A single purpose company, <Italfunding\nLtd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds on\nthe international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs of\nMexico's official debt to Italy at very attractive rates,\nMorgan Grenfell and Co Ltd said as lead manager and arranger.\n    The transaction will be accomplished by Italfunding\nobtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market and\nthen using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amount\nto Mexico. The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, the\nofficial Italian export credit agency.\n    Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the\npast to help refinance export credits for other indebted\ncountries, such as Brazil and Ecuador.\n    The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a\nfloating rate note. This transaction makes use of another\nsector of the capital markets -- that for short-term note\nfacilities -- to finance a medium term credit.\n    The financing is being arranged in connection with a\nbilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this year\nto refinance Mexico's official debt to Italy.\n    The bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling\nagreement reached last September of Mexico's official debt to\nthe Paris Club of western creditor governments.\n    The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-based\nrescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexico's\nforeign debt.\n    That package -- heralded as the first to incorporate all\naspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's plan to aid\nindebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which\nwas signed today in New York.\n     The new financing for\nItalfunding, being syndicated among about five major\ninternational banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving\nfacility with an average life of seven years and the facility\nwill fund the loan.\n    All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted\noutline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be\nnegotiated on a bilateral basis.\n    Banking sources noted that the use of a special-purpose\nvehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractive\nfinancing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (Libor).\n    The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of\n13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.\n    This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in\nthis case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply\non the international markets. At the same time, the deal\nbenefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on\nthe note facility, which is pure Italian risk.\n    The bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged\nin Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would have\nbeen higher since the Italian banks would use a different\nsource of funding.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Morgan Guaranty Ltd's novel and complex\nrepackaging of Westpac Banking Corp's perpetual floating rate\nnote (FRN) may attract some investors, but is unlikely to aid\ncurrent holders of the Westpac securities or the FRN market,\nFRN traders said.\n    \"It actually does nothing for anyone who has been stuffed\nand right now, that's the problem,\" said a trader at one U.K.\nClearing bank that has also issued its own perpetuals.\n    Trading in perpetual issues, which pay interest but never\nmature, has come to a virtual halt. Prices have fallen so far\nthat only about five firms still make markets in them.\n    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now the\nproperty of a newly formed single-purpose finance subsidiary,\nPacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for the\nactual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85\ncents on the dollar, at most, traders said.\n    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class of\ninvestor for the notes and take the old issues off their books\nwithout registering a loss, the traders said.\n    \"The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan,\" a trader\nsaid.\n    Meanwhile, the end-holders of perpetual notes, most of whom\nare Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them by\nyear-end, now a week away.\n    From Morgan's point of view, the repackaging does aid the\npresent holders of the notes as well as offering value to a new\nclass of investors.\n    \"At least we've put a floor under the price of the notes.\nWe've created a way to set a real value for them,\" one Morgan\nofficial said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,\nanother plan to repackage the Westpac securities.\n    Morgan's holdings of Westpac paper create special problems\nfor it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings of\nthe primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, it\nis crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.\n    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of the\nrepackaged securities -- which Westpac has offered to redeem\nfor cash in 15 years -- does have real value.\n    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highest\nrate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually any\nnewly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.\n    However, the other portion of the security, in which the\ninvestor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15-year\nbond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumes\na market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.\n    The zero-coupon portion could provide value for an account\nwhich for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, the\ntraders said. In the 15-year period between the time the note\nis purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.\n    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like an\nordinary zero-coupon bond. Instead, the investor receives one\nof the Westpac perpetual floaters.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations\nConference today.\n    The new accord is due to replace the current one, which\nexpires in October.\n    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the\nformal adoption represented \"a historic moment.\"\n    The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented\nthe fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.\nXuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we\noften faced problems.\"\n    The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when\nratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net\nexports and 75 pct of net imports.\n    The new INRA will enter into force definitively when\ngovernments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and\n80 pct of net imports have ratified it.\n    It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31\nthis year.\n    It is expected that provisional entry into force will take\nat least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said.\n    During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock\noperations will be suspended, but the International Natural\nRubber Council will remain in place.\n    Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its\nsuccessor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and\nconsumers of natural rubber over the long term.\n    Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto\nadded. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that\nprevailed throughout this session.\"\n    Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,\nsaid the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality\nof interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as\nit was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the\n1970s.\n    Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis\nof predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for\nmultinational tire companies, whether or not consuming\ncountries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously\nconcerned about security of the rubber supply.\"\n    He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had\nserved the purpose for which it was created.\n    Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession\nto the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the\nnew.\n    Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,\nagreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.\n    But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers\nhad been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.\n    He added that the adoption of the new agreement \"attests to\nthe importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

According to\ncentral bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct\nrate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985.\n     In addition to the miners' strike, about 1,000 railway\nfactory workers of the bolivian labour organization (COB) began\na second day of a hunger strike in the country's main cities to\npress for substantial wage increases, a union leader said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "High interest rates, sluggish global\neconomic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening the\nthird world debt crisis, senior Mexican officials said.\n    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said today's signing of\na 76 billion dlr new-loan and rescheduling package for Mexico\nwas the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort in debt\nmanagement yet achieved for a sovereign borrower.\n    But, in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony, he\nwarned against complacency. \"The debt problem is not solved. If\nanything, it has been exacerbated by recent events.\"\n    \"The inequities of the international economic environment\nconspire against the welfare and stability of developing\ncountries,\" Petricioli added. The debt problem will not be\nsolved unless developing countries are allowed to grow, he\nargued. \"There will be no solution without the further\ndevelopment of trade throughout the world.\".\n    Director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters that\nMexico's economy should resume growth this year, but he said\nexternal conditions are not favorable. Latin America is\ngrappling with adverse terms of trade, for instance, as\nunderlined by the recent slide in coffee prices.\n    Interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms,\nGurria added. \"Inflation has literally disappeared from the\nface of the earth in the industrialized world, but interest\nrates are still near seven pct.\"\n    Industrial powers must also improve the coordination of\ntheir economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth rates\nand to keep export markets open, said Gurria, who is Mexico's\nchief debt negotiator.\n    The officials also had a blunt warning for those banks that\nrefuse to participate in the loan package: Do not expect to get\nmuch business with Mexico in the future.\n    About 60 of Mexico's 430 or so creditor banks worldwide\nhave still to join the loan, but four more acceptances were\nreceived today, according to senior Citibank executive William\nRhodes, who is co-chairman of Mexico's advisory committee.\n    \"Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\nopportunities which its future growth will create.\n    \"Those few who have denied their responsibility have turned\ntheir backs on this remarkable effort of international\ncooperation, on the financial system and on their enlightened\ncolleagues,\" Petricioli said.\n    One way that Mexico could punish recalcitrant banks would\nbe to deny, or at least slow down, applications to convert\nMexican debt into equity investments within the country.\n    \"We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the\nrequests of banks that have supported us,\" Gurria said, adding,\n\"We have long memories.\"\n    Debt-equity conversions are an attractive way for banks to\nprovide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in Mexico\nand to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their own\nMexican exposure in the process.    \n    The growing popularity of the scheme was underlined this\nweek when American Express Bank, which has joined the new\nMexican package, said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of its\nown loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in Mexico.\n    Mexico halted the debt-equity program on Feb. 25 to force\nbanks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage, and\nGurria said it would resume once the first part of the six\nbillion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed.\n    The loan is now 99 pct subscribed. Gurria said Mexico hopes\nto close the books by the middle of April in time for a\ndrawdown by the end of April.\n    Although the agreements were signed in the sumptuous\nsurroundings of a midtown Manhattan hotel, the atmosphere of\nthe signing ceremony was rather subdued, with bankers and\nofficials showing little of the elation and relief that\nnormally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal.\n    After five months of arduous work syndicating the loan,\ndebt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make the\nfinancing process less cumbersome.\n    \"This (package) has been harder than all the others... I\nhope we find a way that's not so debilitating for the people\nwho have to put them together,\" Gurria said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The gain is slightly higher\nthan the expected gain the company predicted in February\nbecause additional shares of the unit were sold.\n    In response to a question, Tsai said American Can's\ninvestment in Jefferies and Co is \"very small\".\n    \"We treat it as just another passive investment,\" he said.\nAccording to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of\nJefferies and is its largest single shareholder.\n    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, chairman and founder of the\nbrokerage firm bearing his name, resigned from the firm and\nsaid he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking\nsecurities laws.\n    Responding to another question, Tsai said AIDS-related\nclaims were a small portion of claims made with American Can's\ninsurance subsidiaries in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "There are heightened fears that \"El\nNino\" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the\n1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents\nand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the\nU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field\nreport.\n    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,\nflooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to\nincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.\n    However, it said official sources still believe that this\nyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.\n    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and\nwaters in the pacific.\n    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being\nexperienced has not had an overall negative impact on\nagricultural production.\n    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce\nyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the\ncrop cycle.\n    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where\nexcessive moisture exists, it said.\n    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply\nof irrigation water in the major dams which will improve\nprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and\nslow the decline in sugar production, it said.\n    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could\nreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish\ncatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in\n1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.\n    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three\nto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high\nenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.\n    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will\nintensify and carry on through late March, April and May\ncausing problems as crops approach harvest.\n    \"There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino\n-- only time will tell,\" the report said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln\nstg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.\n    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost\nof slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs\nassociated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the\ncompany, Holden-Brown also said.\n    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary\ngain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct\ninterest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.\n    \"So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But\nhopefully you win them all in the end,\" Holden-Brown said.\n    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other\ntake-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: \"No, I don't.\"\n    \"We must never be complacent and we must always be very\nwatchful, but I think we would be very expensive,\" he said.\n    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate\nearnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies\nin the food and beverage industry.\n    \"That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had\ncome a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I\nthink,\" Holden-Brown said.\n    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram\nWalker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders\ntake-over bid for the company was \"100 pct a growth action.\"\n    \"We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and\nthat people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)\ndefensive, but it never was,\" Holden-Brown told reporters.\n    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share\nissue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram\nWalker, Holden-Brown responded: \"Plan might be too strong a\nword. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be\nbetter known in Canada.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "American Express Co said it was\nsubpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in\nconnection with documents on transactions in securities of\nAmerican Express and its former unit, Fireman's Fund.\n    American Express said its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman\nBrothers Inc was also served with a subpoena. Shearson acted as\nco-manager in the underwriting of units of Fireman's common\nstock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,\nit said.\n    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates to\ntransactions with Jefferies and Co and others.\n    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply with\nall requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. American\nExpress said neither company is aware of any unlawful conduct\nwith respect to the matters and a thorough investigation is\ncontinuing.\n    American Express said the subpoenas were received\nyesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiry\nprior to receiving the subpoenas.\n    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, said\nhe agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities\nviolations.\n    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities and\nExchange Commission of market manipulation and another scheme\nwith Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insider\ntrading.\n    Jefferies' firm was censured by the SEC and ordered to\nretain an outside consultant to review its procedures.\n    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did not\nidentify who was involved in the market manipulation scheme\naside from Jefferies. It said \"a certain issuer,\" which held\ncontrolling interest in a second public company, offered\nseveral mln shares of the company's common stock to the public\nin a secondary offering during 1986.\n    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a scheme\nwith an unidentified person to drive up the price of the second\ncompany's stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferies\nfirm trade in the stock.\n    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the loss\nfrom those trading activities after sending a fake invoice to\nanother unnamed person, the government charged.\n    American Express first offered Fireman's Fund Corp's stock\nto the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to\n41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27\npct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.\n    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrant\nto buy Fireman's fund. The warrants are exercisable from the\nissue date through March, 1989.\n    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directly\nto Fireman's Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrants\nare exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.\n    American Express said if all warrants were exercised it\nwould own about 13 pct of Fireman's fund.\n    American Express stock fell 1-1/2, to 77-1/4 on volume of\n1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,\nfirst on rumors, then an announcement of an understanding\nAmerican Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13\npct of Shearson.\n    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Express\nwill sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.\n    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believe\nthe subpoenas will affect Nippon's deal with American Express,\nbut it could result in a delay of the public offering\nanticipated for Shearson.\n\n    \"If they're forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearson\na little longer...big deal. They're certainly not going to\nthrow Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset,\" he\nsaid.\n    American Express has not commented on speculation it would\noffer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it was\ncontinuing to review options for the brokerage.\n    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearson\nwould be forthcoming shortly.\n    \"It puts a cloud over it for a while...The market is\nanxious to see them consumate whatever they were going to\nconsumate,\" Lewis said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed\npublic offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is\nseen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,\nanalysts said.\n    \"In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on\nits gaming businesses,\" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler\nAmdec Securities Inc.\n    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of\nanother non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,\nwhich analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.\n    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said \"the company currently\nhas no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club\ncompany, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the\noffering goes.\"\n    Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit\nhad 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2\nmln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the\nunit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.\n    Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit\ncould be the first step to selling it.\n    \"It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the\nhealth club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating\nincome, making it an attractive buy to a third party,\" Steven\nEisenberg of Bear Stearns said.\n    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8\nmln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.\n   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce\nparent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6\nbillion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase\nof shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile\ntakeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.\n    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a\nseparate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible\nsubordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of\nshort term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally\nspokesperson said.\n    Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have\nremained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long\nrange prospects.\n    \"The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has\ngrown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a\npermanent part of our lifestyle,\" said Eisenberg of Bear\nStearns.\n    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the\npublic stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that\novercapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.\n     In addition, \"the returns in the fitness club industry are\njust not as high as they are in the gaming industry,\" said one\nanalyst.\n     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding\nclubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the\nAssociation of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be\nan 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.\n     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the\nnation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, \"no one has\nthe money to offer to buy it.\"\n    \"The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no\nleader and there is a great opportunity for growth through\nacquisition and then standardization,\" said Wayne LaChapelle,\nchief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's\nsecond largest fitness chain operator whih\n    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in\nacquisition opportunities but \"could not afford an acquisition\nthe size of Bally at this time.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A financial newsletter which reported\nlast November that car maker Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> lost large\nsums in currency transactions alleged that unnamed banks had\ncircumvented banking regulations with help from VW's foreign\nexchange department.\n    VW had no immediate comment and there was nothing in the\nreport by the newsletter, the Platow Brief, to link its new\nallegations with a suspected currency swindle at VW which is\nnow being investigated by a prosecutor.\n    VW said this month that it had had to make provision for\npossible losses up to 480 mln marks in the possible currency\nfraud.\n    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in\nWest Berlin said the office was aware that the newsletter had\nmade the new allegations and would follow this with interest.\n    Platow Brief said around 16 mainly foreign banks based in\nWest Germany had \"parked\" excess open positions in currency\ntrading with VW's foreign exchange department.\n    Under West German banking law, banks may not end a trading\nday with open positions totalling more than 30 pct of their\ncapital. During the day banks buy and sell currencies, usually\naiming to match up all deals by the end and balance their\nbooks.\n    Some traders who take a view on how currencies will move\nmay prefer to leave certain positions open, a speculative\nsituation that the German regulations are designed to limit.\n    According to Platow Brief, some traders apparently were\ngetting round the regulation by getting VW to buy or sell\ncurrencies and hold them temporarily so that their books were\nsquared. Up to 100 mln dlrs was sometimes involved.\n    Non-bank corporations are not covered by the restrictions,\nimposed after a bank crash in 1974 to protect bank depositors.\n    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by\na fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases by\nremoval of the managers, if their active involvement is proved.\n    But the Federal Banking Supervisory Office said it first\nhad to be established how far, if at all, regulations were\nbreached.\n    The suspected VW currency swindle meanwhile involved\noperations to protect the company against fluctuations in the\nvalue of the dollar, VW spoksmen have said.\n    Some operations to hedge against changes in currency values\nwere not completed, meaning VW stood to lose money.\n    A senior executive has been fired and several other people\nsuspended, while a prosecutor is looking into the matter.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Soviet Union's winter grain\ncrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting\nconditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of\nworld weather and crop conditions said.\n    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the\nEF Hutton publication \"Global Crop News,\" said in her latest\nreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,\nfrom the U.S. due to potential crop damage.\n    \"Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet\nwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,\" she said. \"But\nit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot\nwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the\ntroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.\"\n    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably\nprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat\ngrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus\nreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.\n    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record\nlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its\ntoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.\n    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had\nample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority\nof crop areas from severe frost damage.\n    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains\nin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from\nCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,\nMartell said.\n    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop\nproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.\n    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on\nmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather\nnecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.\n    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986\ngrain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl\naccident may have contaminated more grain than originally\nthought and have to be made up with imports.\n    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last\nresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only\njust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the\n1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.\n    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980\ngrain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the\nUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.\n    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain\nimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union\nbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only\n24 pct of that total.\n    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87\nwas 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their\nestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Additional capital inflows of 1.5\nbillion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to\nabout eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel\nGurria told reporters.\n    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved\ninvestor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has\nforced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows\ntotalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.\n    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the\nsake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of\nfunds available for badly needed investment.\n    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is\ndrawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have\nenough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or\nfive months, Gurria noted.\n    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on\nthe commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support\ncontingency facility. That money will be available until April\n1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall\nbelow certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the\nfirst two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said\ntoday, \"We expect we'll never have to use it.\"\n    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on\nthe second contingency facility included in the bank financing\npackage - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World\nBank.\n    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed\nyesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the\ndevelopment of exports of manufactured goods.\n    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion\ndlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and\nexport promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.\n    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its\nInternational Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days\nbased on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.\n    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of\ndiscussions which will determine quantitative economic targets\nfor 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF\nfor the rest of 1987.\n    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight\nbilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris\nClub.\n    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella\nagreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs\nof official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize\npacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.\n    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he\nsaid all countries from the Organization of Economic\nCooperation and Development have continued to provide export\ncredit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Diplomats said this was expected when EC\nenvironment ministers meet next on May 21.\n    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany\ndid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide\nban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.\n    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats\nsaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20\nmln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no\ndamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.\n    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special\npermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition\nlaws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement\na ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The company declined to say how much the cost\nsavings would amount to.\n    A five year forecast is expected to be issued in early\nsummer, a spokesperson said.\n    The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high\ncost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year.\n    For 1986, Niagara Mohawk's earnings per share fell to 2.71\ndlrs from 2.88 dlrs in 1985..\n    The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of\na reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed\nby the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission.\n    Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering\nof authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a \nfair return on equity.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
