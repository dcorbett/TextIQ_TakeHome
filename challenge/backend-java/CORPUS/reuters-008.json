        "body": "The U.S. Agriculture Department \nformally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to\ndrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers\nfor the cut with targeted income payments.\n    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying\nthe \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers,\nDeputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration\nwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning\nwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.\n    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the\ngovernment for the price support cut with targeted income\npayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would\ncost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\n    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\nintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\nJohn Porter, R-Ill.\n    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\nis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\npolitically-influential sugar and corn growers\nand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\n    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \ntargets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\nlowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\nany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\n    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\nwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\ncts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\n    The income payments would be based on the amount of\ncommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\nor 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\n    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\nin the sugar program because the current high price support is\ncausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\n    He said the current program has artificially stimulated\ndomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\ncorn sweeteners to make market inroads.\n    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\n\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\nmln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\nrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\n    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\noverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\ncompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of\nsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing\nfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.\n    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on\nU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said\nconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than\nnecessary for sugar.\n    \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between\nsweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse\nimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently\nfacing,\" Myers said.\n    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per\nlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons\nrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to\ncompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.\n    QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991\nFirst 350 tons         6.000    4.500     3.000     1.500\nOver 350 to 700        5.750    4.313     2.875     1.438\nOver 700 to 1,000      5.500    4.125     2.750     1.375\nOver 1,000 to 1,500    5.000    3.750     2.500     1.250\nOver 1,500 to 3,000    4.500    3.375     2.250     1.125\nOver 3,000 to 6,000    3.500    2.625     1.750     0.875\nOver 6,000 to 10,000   2.250    1.688     1.125     0.563\nOver 10,000 to 20,000  0.500    0.375     0.250     0.125\nOver 20,000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The St. Lawrence Seaway, set\nto reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year\nbecause of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the\nfirst strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials\nsaid.\n    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes\nof transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal\nincrease over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on\nthe 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.\n    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the\nseaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal\nand Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,\nlinking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled\nthrough the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through\nthe eight-lock canal.\n    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs\nthis year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal\n1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive\nmember of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.\n    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.\nThose exports of the single most important commodity carried on\nthe waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.\n    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about\n2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said\nit will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'\ndemands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.\n    \"It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,\" Roman\nGralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.\n    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator\nto try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two\nsides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on\nthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.\n    \"We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a\nprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway\nAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.\n    \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the\nSt Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the\nCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major\nCanadian shipping companies, said recently.\n    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The\nassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages\nfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to\nrestructure crew dispatching.\n    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs\n(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and\nfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985\nwas its worst year in two decades.\n    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on\nthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last\nyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls\nthroughout the rest of the waterway.\n    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and\nabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.\n    \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we\nwon't see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.\n    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers\nin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this\nseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,\nBlair said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The four-times-a-year \"triple\nwitching hour\" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has in\nthe past.\n    Market averages finished sharply higher as stock index\nfutures, index options and options on individual stocks expired\nsimultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may be\nretraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is getting\nused to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity in\nthe final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchange\nsaid the day went smoothly and efficiently.\n    \"This has been one of the few times that the consensus has\nbeen right,\" said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch\nand Co.\n    He expects a \"follow-through\" Monday and Tuesday to the\nadvance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 points\nfor the day and 75 points for the entire week.\n    Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved in\narbitrage activity involving index futures and options, said\nthe general trend of the market has been upward for months.\n\"Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with more\nmoney,\" he said.\n    He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accounts\nprior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japanese\ninvestors are apparently helping push stocks higher.\n    Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc,\nsaid reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end of\nthe fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.\n    He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedged\nwith short positions in index futures rolled the expiring March\nfutures over into June contracts. But he added different\nplayers with other goals also were active and there was no\nsimple explanation of the market's gyrations.\n    For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the June\nStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15\nminutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, the\ncontracted dipped to 297.50. \"That could have been a wave of\nselling from institutional people making a roll,\" he said.\n    It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500\nhit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. \"It looks\nlike the market is going to continue to go higher,\" he said.\n    \"Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was a\nstrong day for stocks,\" said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney,\nHarris Upham and Co.\n    Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by\n\"good solid buying interest\" which will cushion any pullback.\n    Other investors who were long futures and short stocks\nbought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, said\nMark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against\n\"over-dramatizing\" the day's activity, which said was more a\nreflection of fundamental strength in the markets.\n    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was\nmostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options\nand individual options expired. He said there could be a\ndecline early next week in the stock market.\n    \"It looked like it worked well today,\" said Howard Kramer,\nasssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and\nExchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have to\nbe analyzed next week.\n    He said there was relatively little commotion at the close,\nwith about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minute\ncompared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three months\nearlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points in\nthe closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.\n    Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility,\ndisclosure of \"market-on-close\" orders in 50 major stocks 30\nminutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances of\nmodest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening out\nvolatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of the\nimbalance.\n    The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47\nstocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, and\nno significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tightened\na rule governing what type of market on close orders can be\naccepted in the final half hour.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in\nadvance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with\nPrime Minister Brian Mulroney.\n    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs\ngroup, Clark said that the two countries must find better\nmechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.\n    \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on\ncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were\nquasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place\nnow are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he\nsaid.\n    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules\non government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he\nsaid.\n    \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to\nsecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to\nmove their head offices out of our country into your country\nbecause you have national procurement requirements,\" he said.\n    In turn, he added, the United States would like to change\nsome of the procurement requirements that exist at the\nprovincial government level in Canada.\n    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.\n    \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in\nthe first instance, to propose, and then governments and\ncongresses will have judge,\" he said.\n    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States\nhas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to\nits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.\n\"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year\nthan you bought from Canada,\" he said.

The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from\n43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.\n    The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pct\nsurtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000\ndlrs, he said.\n    In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax on\nall individuals with taxable income.\n    Johnston said overall government spending of 10.42 billion\ndlrs represents a cut of 4.4 pct, but various grants and tax\ncredits for agriculture and energy industries will remain.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Higher crude oil prices will raise\ndemand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost\nto heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.\n    The analysts said that these efforts will be most\nsuccessful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large\nand growing energy requirements.\n    \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of\noil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual\nfuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energy\neconomist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.\n    An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went\ninto the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last\nyear when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. \n    Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national\naverage gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected\n2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,\nMichael German, vice president of economic analysis at American\nGas Association said.\n    The average delivered prices at the end of January were\n2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.\n    \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic\nfeet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and\nthird quarter (1987),\" he said.\n    In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be\nan important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,\nFrank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.\nin New York noted.\n    Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North\nAmerican continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and\nless would be necessary to replenish underground storage this\nspring freeing gas for spot sales.\n    These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears\nthat natural gas suplies would be tight and prices\nsignificantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last\nyear.\n    AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,\nmuch of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production\nquickly through developments such as the infill drilling which\npermits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.\n    Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus\nwas likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986\nto two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not\ngo away until 1990.\n    Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would\npersist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain\nconsuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast\nU.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The United States will likely impose\nsanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said\ntoday after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm\nBaldrige.\n    Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision\nwould be taken until a final determination is made on whether\nJapanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said\nthey were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.\n    President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which\nBaldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.\n    \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain,\nan Arizona Republican, told reporters.\n    \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than\nsanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.\n    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor\nindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department\nofficials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September\n1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United\nStates and other countries.\n    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through\ntariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for\ncontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100\nmln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.\n    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.\nPete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is\nthat there will be.\"\n    \"Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions\nmust be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the\nCalifornia Republican said.\n    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips\nwhich are used in high technology products ranging from radios\nto defence missile guidance systems.\n    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told\nthem the administration had not made a final determination that\nJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below\nthe cost of production in the United States or other countries.\n    But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt\ndumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of\npurchases of the Japanese products.\n    The two countries signed a pact last September in which\nJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United\nStates and other countries below production costs and to allow\nthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.\n    In return, the United States waived its right to impose\nimport duties on the Japanese microchips.\n    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact\nand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to\nsave the pact.\n    Japan has frequently been the target of congressional\ndiscouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade\ndeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United\nStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries.\n    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution\ncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pact\nsince September. The resolution will be introduced in the House\nnext week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bolivia, once Latin America's most\ndelinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International\nMonetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program\nhas effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.\n    A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz\nshortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.\n    He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln\ndlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this\nmonth. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited\ninflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were\nlosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on\nthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.\n    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-\nrelated rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off\nthousands of workers in state corporations.\n    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past\nsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government \nexpects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct\ncontraction over the last six years.\n    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its\ndebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest\nhas not been paid since March, 1984.\n    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would\nmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at\nthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- \n10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\nand gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\nsupply in the region.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock\nas the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding\nexport quotas or production controls.\n    The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under\nthe auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD).\n    In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble\nthose contained in the present one.\n    The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore\ncts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and\nOctober 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the\ndaily market indicator price remains above the upper\nintervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower\nintervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months.\n    If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely\nconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts\n-- the price would be revised under the current accord by five\npct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber\nCouncil decides.\n    The new reference price would then be taken over for the\nnew agreement.\n    Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference\nprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless the\nCouncil decides on a higher percentage.\n    Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to\n300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the\nreference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless\nthe Council decides on a higher percentage.\n    Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price\nreviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.\n    Those changes are intended to make the reference price more\nresponsive to market trends.\n    As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels\nare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the\n\"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it.\n    The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling\nprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the\nCouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.\n    During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal\nthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the\nsame as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision\nfor an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.\n    Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be\nbrought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.\n    At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for\nproducers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact\nhad served the purpose for which it had been created.\n    Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,\nagreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\"\n    Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,\ndelegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord\nhad maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level.\n    They said the agreement until now did not appear to have\nencouraged excessive production of rubber.\n    In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer\nstock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a\nsort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said.\n    The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.\nHeadquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.\n    To become operational, it will require ratification by\ncountries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of\nworld imports.\n    Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from\nnow. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the\nInternational Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.\n    The pact will enter into force definitively when\ngovernments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct\nof world imports have ratified it.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed\ndiscussions with ministers tomorrow.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely\nhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and\ngas revenues in half.\n    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to\nprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia\npay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.\n    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to\nthe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31\npct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to\nbridge its deficit.\n    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto\nand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy\nchange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost\nprotected economy.\n    \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call\nfor major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said\nin his arrival statement.\n    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next\nmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that\nthe Bank is demanding specific changes.\n    \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the\neconomy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at\nJakarta airport.\n    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling\n37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the\nThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7\nbillion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.\n    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would\nlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes\nalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.\n    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,\nthe Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the\ngovernment's trade reform measures, and supported its\ndetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.\n    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last\nMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage\noutside investment.\n    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look\ninto which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be\nsold.\n    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the\ngovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.\n    Western analysts say that in particular the government is\nunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost\nmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy.\n    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that\nIndonesia faced very limited economic choices.\n    It could not spend its way out of trouble because this\nwould increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic\ninflation.\n     He said the main objective was to raise exports outside\nthe oil and natural gas sector.\n    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the\ngovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial\nyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in\n1986/87.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bundesbank vice-president Helmut\nSchlesinger said that although West German economic growth was\nnot expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, two\npct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.\n    A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen export\nprospects and have a negative effect on investments, he told\nthe Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if such\nan appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.\n    The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2\npct or more in its annual economic report published in January,\nbut some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.\n    Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to rise\nstrongly. Government expenditure and construction were also\nexpected to increase. But there was uncertainty about the\nprospects for exports and investment.\n    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply\novershoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an\neffect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, there\nwere potential dangers in the long run.\n    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the West\nGerman money supply would grow within the three to six pct\ntarget zone set in December.\n    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the\ndrop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for\nsome time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise between\none and two pct this year.\n    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for\nthe West German economy. Although there was a possibility of a\ndownturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this\nwould happen in 1988.\n    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from its\nclose ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. House Ways and Means\nCommittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said a tax increase\nprobably would be needed but that Congress and President Regan\nmight not approve one.\n    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, also told the Futures\nIndustry Association that he did not think congressional tax\nwriters would approve a tax on stock transfers or ease taxes to\npromote U.S. Exports.\n    He congratulated House Speaker James Wright for proposing\ntax increases to help cut the budget deficit.\n    Rostenkowski said he hoped White House Chief of Staff\nHoward Baker could persuade President Reagan to support a\npackage of tax increases and spending cuts.\n    He noted that Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker both\nsupported tax increases in l982.\n    Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of new\ntaxes might have to be found, along with nine billion in\ndefence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domestic\nspending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would be\nbrought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders felt\nthere was Republican support.\n    A string of indictments of Wall Street figures could move\nsome in Congress to support a tax on stock transfers, he said.\n    \"But the fact many people don't like what's happening in\nfinancial markets doesn't mean they will be hit with a tax,\" he\nsaid, noting that Wright's securities tax idea had not been\n\"fleshed out.\"\n    Efforts by special interests to rewrite provisions of the\ntax reform bill will fall on deaf ears, Rostenkowski predicted.\n    The chief House tax writer also predicted congress would\napprove legislation to reform the welfare system.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the\nrules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts\nsee as a means of defending the naira currency, which has\ndepreciated steadily.\n    The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks\nbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they\noffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest\nsuccessful bid made at the auction.\n    This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure\nthat they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate,\nanalysts said.\n    \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if\nthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a\nWestern diplomat commented.\n    The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct\nsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange\nMarket (SFEM), began last September 26.\n    At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at\n4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.\n    \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of\ntrying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said.\n    The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be\nfortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.\n    It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's\nscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was\nplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer\nat each auction.\n    Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped\nsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further\nweakening the naira.\n    If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the\nfortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective\nof the new system, analysts said.\n    Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the\nofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to business\ntransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the\nlowest successful bid.\n    SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment\nprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic\nrecovery plan in Black Africa.\n    The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for\nthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising\nimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing\ninefficient government participation in the economy.\n    The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing\nthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often\nsceptical public which fears inflation and lower living\nstandards.\n    Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,\nsaid yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment\nprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.\n    \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,\nadding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite\nwould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.\n    Fears that the program would encourage inflation were\nincorrect, he said.\n    Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban\nprices had already reflected the naira's black market value\nbefore the currency was allowed to find its true level last\nSeptember.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazil's attempt to seek better\nterms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is\nresponsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan's\nCouncil of Economic Advisers said.\n    \"I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its\ndebt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a\nresponsible request on their part,\" economist Martin Feldstein\nsaid at a news conference.\n    \"It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but\nrather modest additional amounts.\"\n    Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral\nCommission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business\nand government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.\n    Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third\nWorld debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additional\ncredit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and\ninternational agencies.\n    \"Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remain\nconstant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in\nBrazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in\nthe real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,\" he said.\n    Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt\nproblems were less serious than those faced by the\ninternational monetary system in 1983 and 1985.\n    However, the European representative on the task force,\nHerve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank\nPLC, disagreed.\n    He called the present situation more difficult and, in a\ndraft proposal included in the task force's report, suggested\nsetting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with\na fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.\n    Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was\napparent from the news conference that task force members did\nnot agree on all points in their report.\n    One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor\ncountries would need additional credit in the coming years if\nthey are to enjoy satisfactory growth.\n    Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei\nNarusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of\nToyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how\nmuch credit would be needed.\n    He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing\ninternational banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe,\nwould be to lend the money.\n    The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David\nRockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to\npromote closer cooperation among the three regions.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "President Jose Sarney, whose handling\nof the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held\nprivate talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that\ngovernment policies are leading to recession.\n    Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo owned\nby millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline, Sarney met more\nthan 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil's economic crisis.\n    Business leaders said before the meeting they would be\npressing for less government interference in what they describe\nas a tightly regulated economy.\n    Their concerns include the country's high rates of interest\nand tough restrictions on imports.\n    Machline, president of the Sharp electronics group and a\npersonal friend of Sarney's, told television reporters outside\nhis farm that he wanted \"less government participation in the\neconomy.\"\n    When the government announced a month ago that it was\nsuspending interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr debt to\ncommercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growth\nand avoiding recession.\n    But business leaders and economic analysts say there are\ngrowing signs that Brazil's economy, the eighth biggest in the\nnon-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pct\ngrowth last year.\n    Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on\nindustry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year\nbecause of the country's deteriorating trade balance.\n    Cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally owned\nBanco do Brasil, has told companies they must limit their\nimports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.\n    Business sources say that in practice importing even this\namount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n    The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in many\nsectors of the economy there was a real fear that production\nlines would grind to a halt next month.\n    One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato, head of\nthe powerful Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation (FIESP).\n    Business sources said he would argue that unless there were\na relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial\nactivity was inevitable.\n    Relations between Sarney and the business community have at\ntimes been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed\nup the importance of the meeting.\n    In one bizarre dispute in January, Sarney surprised\nBrazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies\nof the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburst\ncame after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying\ngovernment regulations on price controls.\n    Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance\nMinister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government's\neconomic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and\nwants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.\n    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove\nloans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings\nand resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's\ntaste.\n    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is\nexpected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a\nspeech to the bank's annual meeting on Monday.\n    But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United\nStates has some room for compromise and also to fend off other\nchallenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to\ninnovative solutions to the debt problem.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Our\nfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us\nall,\" Moore said.\n    He added: \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is\nour last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not\nget another chance before the year 2000.\"\n    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade\nsince the \"Uruguay round\" talks last Sepember. The meeting is\nalso part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in\nJune.\n    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have\nbeen particularly successful, with northern hemisphere\ncountries managing to have service industries such as banking\nand insurance included in the next full round.\n    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and\ntropical products also was met.\n    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is\ndescribed by participants as informal and no declaration is\nexpected.\n    Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political\nurgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"\n    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to\npeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the\nbenefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation\nwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"\n    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations\nincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.\n    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter.\n    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way\nto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to\nimplement four key Uruguay proposals:\n    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;\n    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT\nregulations;\n    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called\nintellectual property such as trademarks, patents and\ncopyrights;\n    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92\nmember states.\n    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade\nMinister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks\nfor domestic political reasons.\n    Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French\ndelegation.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

I will work to reach\nthat solution,\" he said in the interview conducted in Paris.\n    An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical\nexports over a set quota has strained trade relations between\nthe two sides.\n    GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE\nand Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on\nEuropean exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached.\n    Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a\nlong time because there were 20 countries involved. But added:\n\"Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for\nmaking crucial progress.\"\n    Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should\ncontinue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties.\n    He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some\nproblems were solved as a result of the contacts while others\nremained unresolved. He gave no details but said: \"France wishes\nto have normal relations with Iran.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Australia based <Ariadne\nAustralia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to\nfulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine\nbrewing firm, <San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said.\n    The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of\nAustralian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that <Barwon\nFarmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns\na 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.\n    He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a\ntotal 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.\n    Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San\nMiguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons\nspokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be\nsold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.\n    He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government\nwhich seized the block of shares from the United Coconut\nPlanters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the\ncountry's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.\n    He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon\nand the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only\noffer in cash, the newspaper reported.\n    Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours\nthat <Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which\ncontrolled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the\nother party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.\n    The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last\nMay against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel\nshares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo\nCojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.\n    Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government\nwould not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding\nSan Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.\n    The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent\nyesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,\nNew Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent\nto five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares\nfrom the government.\n    \"Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the\nPhilippines' yearly budget,\" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo\nPanganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.\n    Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not\navailable for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines.\n    <San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a Hong Kong listed company which\nis 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp,\nclosed 40 cents higher at 15.50 H.K.

        "body": "King Fahd of Saudi Arabia begins a\nfour-day state visit on Tuesday which will focus on redressing\nBritain's large trade surplus with the kingdom and reaffirming\nties between the traditionally close countries.\n    British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restore\ndiplomatic relations with Syria, broken off by London last\nOctober after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showed\nSyrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner.\n    But one official said the king would be told Britain still\nneeds \"clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians have\nrenounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't.\"\n    Britain will stress its support for an international peace\nconference on the Middle East and its concern over alleged\nhuman rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank and\nGaza, the officials told Reuters.\n    The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime Minister\nMargaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip\nduring the visit, his first to Britain since he assumed power\nin June 1982.\n    King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade, defence, oil\nand health ministers, who will hold talks with their British\ncounterparts.\n    Relations between the two countries have generally been\nwarm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35\nBritish nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and the\npublication of a letter by a retired British ambassador\ndescribing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant.\n    Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in the\nMiddle East.\n    Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to Saudi\nArabia last year while British imports from that country in the\nsame period totalled 436 mln.\n    Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain can\noffer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever arms\nexport order.\n    Under the five billion stg deal signed last year, Saudi\nArabia has agreed to buy 132 warplanes including 72 Tornado\nfighters.\n    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer is likely to discuss oil\nprice stabilisation but Britain would not change its refusal to\nlimit its North Sea oil production and exports, officials said.\n    Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has asked\nall oil-producing countries to help stabilise oil prices at 18\ndlrs a barrel by curbing output and exports.\n    King Fahd's trip follows several visits to Saudi Arabia by\nBritish officials in recent months. Britain's Prince Charles\nand Princess Diana went to Saudi Arabia in November.\n    There were two previous state tours of Britain by Saudi\nmonarchs. King Faisal visited in 1967 and King Khaled in 1981.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The\nbank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.\n    Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher\ncapital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided\ninstead to close its operation, banking sources said.\n    Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while\nthe branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.\n    Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an\nexception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.\nThey said the gesture refelcted close political ties between\nJordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.\n    The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to\n550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It's\nextremely strong,\" he said.\n    \"As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged\nhere in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading\nsystem, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)\ngoes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path\nthat the world did in the late 1930s,\" he said.\n    While relative exchange rates had a role to play in\ndefusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer\nany solution, he said.\n    \"You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,\nbut it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's\nfar more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of\nit requires a comprehensive approach,\" Baker said in the\ninterview.\n    Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to\nadjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their\nbarriers to U.S. Imports.

        "body": "A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury\nsupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit\nmarket, but at least this week's offerings should provide it\nwith some focus, economists said.\n    \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to\nwork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\"\nsaid economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.\n    The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of\ntwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block\nthis week.\n    The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in\nnew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for\nauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on\nWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on\nThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and\nsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.\n    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly\nauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting\nsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy\nU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in\nFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.\n    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared\nunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in\nhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.\nEquities.\n    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are\nsigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a\nbit.\n    \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,\nand there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly\nreport.\n    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes\nbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's\nsales.\n    \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.\nThough the yield spread to the cost of carrying these\nmaturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a\nweekly market review.\n    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate\nenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the\noverseas markets have had their run.\n    \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate\nthat the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists\nat Salomon Brothers Inc.\n    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors\nare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the\nhigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year\non April 1.\n    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big\nbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.\nAuctions, such reports undermine market confidence.\n    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian\nmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies\nshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond\nmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.\n    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the\nU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,\neconomists said.\n    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with\nFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from\nJanuary's depressed levels.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said\nseveral areas, including transport equipment, should have\nbounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap\ntotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after\nJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain\nas large as five pct.\n    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to\nshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.\nEconomists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the\nJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food\nprices declined.\n    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate\nwill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the\napproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.\n    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this\nweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in the\nnew statement period beginning on Thursday.\n    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected\nto open near that level.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Other clients would have to give up their\nanonymity and reveal their identities to the bank.\n    Commission President Hermann Bodenmann said the Commission\nwas likely to discuss the proposal at today's meeting with the\nbankers, and during its own council session on Tuesday. He\ndeclined further comment.\n The banks draw up their own rules of conduct. But banking\nanalysts said the banks cannot afford to ignore the views of\nthe Commission, which is ultimately responsible for preventing\nabuses.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The solution of the world's debt\ncrisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of\nprotectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the\nFederal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.\n    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner\nBank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's\nsuspension last month of part of its interest payments would\nlead to a chain reaction in Latin America.\n    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor\ncountries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from\nexports to repay foreign debt, he said.\n    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but\nBrazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of\nappropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring\nback financial stability to that country.\n    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken\nnow. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to\nrepay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions\nimproved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen\nthe economic position of these countries, to ensure world\neconomic growth so they are able to sell their products at\nadequate prices.\n    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in\ncoordination with governments, international organisations such\nas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and\ncreditor banks.\n    \"This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks\nalone,\" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing\nof debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise\nfunds on international credit markets again. He said a whole\nset of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the\ninternational banking system would provide more funds, but the\nproblem is not just economic but also political.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is\nunder close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow\nBrazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,\nPrime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.\n    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an\ninterview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.\n    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would\ncontinue to do so, but he said creditors and international\ninstitutions should show more \"understanding\" for Yugoslavia's\nsituation.\n    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had \"understanding\" for what Brazil\nhad done.\n    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging\nexports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed\npartial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread\nstrikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army\ncould be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was\nthreatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with\nhard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a\nrecord 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its\noverall debt by 996 mln dlrs.\n    Government ministers told reporters last week they\nregretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the\ncost to the economy had been too great.\n    Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos\nMilosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign\nMinister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, \"radical changes\" in\ninterest rates and repayment times were needed.\n    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those\nof his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen\nahead in financing the debt repayments.\n    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered\nby the Paris club at the end of this month.\n    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed\nthe Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be\nalarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here\nand the possibility of balance of payments problems later this\nyear.\n    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected\nto figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor\nHelmut Kohl.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Both sides in the IMF debate say the course\nthey favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.\n    \"We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, if\nnecessary going to the IMF,\" Mario Amato, president of the Sao\nPaulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.\n     An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very\ndifficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm\nindications such a policy reversal is in the offing.\n    The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance\nis Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present at\nyesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his\nabsence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present\nseized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see\nFunaro leave his job.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "<Dart Group Corp> said it told\nSupermarkets General Corp <SGL> it was flexible on the price it\nwould pay to acquire the company.\n    Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL\nshare if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.\n    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.\n    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was\ndenied confidential information on SGL that would be given to\nother potential bidders.\n    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.\n    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the\nsale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,\nbut not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to\nSGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key\nemployees.\n    \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout\nfirms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL\nmanagement may be considering a leveraged buyout.\n    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a\nfriendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all\nthe terms of its offer.\n    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not\nreceived any other offer.\n    It said it requested the confidential information to better\nunderstand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign\nan agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without\nSGL's approval.\n    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy\nSGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions\nunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly\ntransaction, it said.\n    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.\n    Dart said it requested the information before its meeting\nwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope\nrepresentatives would reach an agreement.\n    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told\nthere were certain issues important to SGL management and while\nthey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take\nthem into account in putting together its package.\n    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln\ndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice\npresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.\n    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'\nseverance agreements, although there was an implication that\nLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their\nown volition.\n    Dart said under their present agreements, none of these\nofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,\nDart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6\nmln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's\nincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost\nof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares\nunless waived by the company's compensation committee.\n    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top\nmanagement's supplemental retirement plan.\n    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance\nobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,\nestimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations\nunder the company's present policy.\n    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to\ndiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to\nnegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.\n    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain\nand Rickels home centres.\n    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed\nby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such\nactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.\n    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their\nfiduciary duty.\n    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an\nunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of\nsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover more\nexpensive.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The government's\nover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting\nAustralia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum\nExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.\n    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is\nderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak\ncrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.\n    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the\ncountry's economic performance directly by acting as a\ndisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting\ntrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.\n    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency\nposition is posing a major economic threat, yet the\ngovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on the\noil industry, Benbow said.\n    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to\nfall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from\n546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the\nBass Strait fields, he said.\n    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the\nthree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.\n    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over\nhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped\nfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from\nexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.\n    Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered\nfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.\n    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to\n680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a\ncrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years\ntime, he said.\n    At present world oil prices and the current value of the\nAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost\nbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.\n    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the\naddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.\n    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five\nyears 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.\n    He called on the government to review its tax policies to\nrestore incentive to exploration.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin\nAmerican debtor nations might damage the world economy.\n    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,\nBaker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,\ncalling it a \"dramatic, overnight solution.\"\n    \"While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some\npolitical appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in\nthe long run,\" he said.\n    The article was published to coincide with a three-day\nmeeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).\n    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third\nWorld debt.\n    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last month\ndeclared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no\nindication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting\nfears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial\ndebt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the\nU.S. Strategy.\n    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial\nbanks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since\nOctober 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.\n    \"Together with expected progress in commercial bank\ndiscussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should\nadd up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors\nin 1987,\" Baker wrote.\n    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted\nfor 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major\ndebtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell\nThird World debt at a discount to investors who then become\nstockholders in firms in these countries. \"These swaps aren't a\npanacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can\nmake progress in reducing the debt burden,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazil wants to resume interest payments\non its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible\nand is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the\npayments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor\nFrancisco Gros said.\n    Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first\nmeeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he was\nappointed last month, also promised a clear statement of\nBrazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.\n    But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was\ninconclusive.\n    The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not\ngive assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion\ndlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.\n    \"It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very far\nat the first meeting,\" one banker said.\n    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting\nhere of the Inter-American Development Bank.\n    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for\na legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank\ncredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the\nend of March.\n    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough\ncredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs\nto request a formal extension of the commitments to head off\npossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.\n    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will\nendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or\nsimply relay it without comment.\n    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's\nmeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable\nlanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.\n    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day\nrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally\nmatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.\nBankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is\nsubject to the moratorium.\n    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days\noverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on\nnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and when\nthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.\n    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter\nwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.\nOther U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.\n    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and\nsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if\nthere was a way round the problem.\n    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan\nmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could\nhappen.\"\n    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the\ncommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with\nBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the\nproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a\ntime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans\ncan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.\n    \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't\nmeet all its obligations,\" he said.\n    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting\ninflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the\npublic sector budget was in operational surplus.\n    But he said there was a need to spell out government\npolicy, especially on prices.\n    \"It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external\nreasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures\nmight be introduced.\n    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the\nbanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed\nby the country's creditors.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Controversy surrounding U.S.-backed\nreforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)\nunderscores the mounting challenge to Washington's current debt\nstrategy, according to Latin American officials and delegates\nto the IADB meeting that begins here today.\n    The bank's policy-making board on Saturday postponed a\ndecision on the reforms until June in view of strong Latin\nAmerican opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its control\nover lending to the region.\n    Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategy\nthrough increased lending, but as the bank's largest single\nshareholder it also wants to require countries to adopt\nfar-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.\n    The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year's\nmeeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in an\ninstitution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of as\ntheir own.\n    \"It's almost an issue of sovereignty for the Latin\nAmericans,\" one IADB official said.\n    With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nations\nhave had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in project\nloans since the bank's founding in 1959.\n    The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by a\nMexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly critical\nof U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.\n    Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to the\nregion if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a news\nconference last week he warned that Latin defaults were a\ndistinct possibility in the long run.\n    Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no\nway interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the\nissue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time,\nofficials and delegates said.\n    They said creditors are not ready to discuss debt\nforgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity\nswaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic\nreforms.\n    Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions on\nlending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations\nfor the bank if it does not get its way.\n    Latin America, while retaining reservations, now accepts\nthe principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is\nunwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powers\non lending, officials and delegates said.\n    Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35\npct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans are\nunwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. To\nline up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.\n    This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, and\nparticularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADB\nunless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable\nresentment among Latin Americans.\n    \"Debtors have already shown considerable willingness to\nsacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is\nnot at issue,\" one Latin American official said.\n    The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of\nIADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as\nagainst 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The World Bank has lent Indonesia 10.7\nbillion dlrs over the past 20 years.\n    Conable arrived here on Saturday and will have talks with\nSuharto tomorrow. Today he was returning to Jakarta from a\nvisit to World Bank-funded projects in eastern Java, and was\nscheduled to meet leading economic ministers in the afternoon.\n    Western diplomats said they expected Conable to press\nIndonesia to maintain the pace of its present economic reforms\nto cope with the slump in its oil revenues.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The paper said the call\nwas recorded by an unidentified man using an electronic radio\nscanner. In a statement Howard said the conversation was\ndamaging to the party and implied disloyalty to him.\n    Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to \"hire\nand fire.\" He refused to answer questions about any leadership\nchallenge.\n    Liberal party officials said the move against Peacock could\nencourage his supporters to mount a challenge to Howard's\nleadership. Peacock was ousted as opposition leader by Howard\nin September 1985, after losing the 1984 general election to\nHawke.\n    Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a veteran\nNational Party member, recently campaigned against Howard's\nleadership and urged his party to split from the coalition.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>\nexpects to increase its market share in West Germany in the\nfull year 1987 after registering gains in the first two months\nof the year, managing board chairman Carl Hahn said.\n    He told Reuters in an interview that incoming orders in\nWest Germany, VW's largest single market, had been very good in\nearly 1987. Its share of the domestic car market rose to 29 pct\nin January and February from 26 pct in the year-ago period.\n    Hahn declined to forecast first quarter 1987 results, or\nanswer questions about the VW currency scandal.\n    Hahn said he did not want to elaborate on statements VW had\nalready issued on the affair and noted the case was now in the\nhands of state prosecutors.\n    VW, like other car manufacturers, had encountered difficult\nmarket conditions in the United States in early 1987, Hahn\nsaid, without giving details.\n    He declined to predict U.S. Sales for 1987 as a whole,\nsaying it was particularly difficult this year to forecast\nsales trends in North America, VW's second largest regional\nmarket after Western Europe.\n    Hahn declined to comment directly on reports that 1986\nlosses at Spanish subsidiary Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles\nde Turismo (SEAT) totalled up to 27 billion pesetas or that\nthese losses were twice as high as expected.\n    But he said SEAT was developing according to plan and added\nthe introduction of international accounting standards and\nchanges to VW's own had led to some corrections to SEAT's\nfigures.\n    VW hoped SEAT would reach break-even point in the course of\nthis year. In 1986 SEAT's volume sales had been better than\nexpected, Hahn said.\n    In January and February, 1987, SEAT's turnover in Europe\nrose 40 pct compared with the same months of 1986, Hahn said.\nIts European market share rose to 1.9 pct in January and\nFebruary from 1.6 pct a year earlier.\n    Hahn said VW hoped to sign a contract with Ford Motor Co\n<F.N> in the summer on the planned joint venture between the\ntwo companies' loss-making operations in Argentina and Brazil.\n    A provisional joint management team was already looking at\nways of synchronising the two operations, he said. VW's\noperations in Mexico had made again made a profit in 1986, he\nadded.\n    Hahn, speaking to Reuters in an interview to mark\nproduction of VW's 50 millionth car, said VW had no plans to\nmake acquisitions outside the automotive sector.\n    It also did not expect to raise capital again in the\nforeseeable future after increasing capital by 25 pct in 1986\nin the biggest rights issue in West German history, Hahn said.\n    In a separate interview Karl-Heinz Briam, the management\nboard member responsible for labour relations, said VW did not\ncurrently plan to increase its workforce further this year.\n    All of VW's domestic plants and most of its foreign\nproduction facilities were currently operating at full\ncapacity, Briam said. The exceptions were VW's Nigerian\noperations and its Westmoreland plant in Pennsylvania.\n    Hahn said VW had recently taken steps to increase the\nflexibility and improve the structure of the Westmoreland\nplant. However, VW was not planning to increase production\nthere at the moment.\n    \"Most of the VW vehicles (sold in the U.S.) will, as before,\nbe built in Germany,\" Hahn said.\n    Hahn said there was room for further growth in West\nGermany, and predicted that 1987 would be a good year generally\nfor the industry domestically.\n    Wolfgang Lincke, head of car development at VW, said the\nincreasing environmental awareness of West German consumers\nwould allow VW to sell more \"higher value\" cars in future\ncontaining equipment such as catalytic converters, which cut\nexhaust emissions.\n    Lincke declined to be drawn on when VW may introduce a\nsuccessor to its current Golf model, which in 1983 replaced the\noriginal dating from 1974.\n    VW would in any case retain the Golf name. Of the 50 mln VW\ncars built since VW started commercial production after World\nWar II, nearly nine mln have been Golfs, Lincke said.\n    VW, which traditionally releases its annual results in\nApril or May, said last week 1986 profit and dividend would\nboth be unchanged despite the need to make provision to cover\nthe possible loss of 480 mln marks from allegedly fraudulent\nhedging operations.\n    VW has also said the currency scandal would not affect the\ncompany's investment spending.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "West German bond yields could decline\nover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize\nexchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to\nkeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.\n    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under\nagreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.\n    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized\ncurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,\neconomists said.\n    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster\nthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates\nfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.\n\"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank\nand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate\nare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.\nand foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent\nstudy.\n    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads\nwas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will\nhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.\n    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged\nthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the\nBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid\nweakening the dollar.\n    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading\nWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.\n    \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank\nAG said.\n    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates\nonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation\nwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.\n    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already\nnearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50\npct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.\n Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to\nshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move\nwould tend to flatten the yield curve between short and\nlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the\nBundesbank lowered its discount rate.\n    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as\nthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow\ngrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.\n    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West\nGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to\nmeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may\nforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must\nbe filled by higher government borrowing.\n    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit\nremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.\n    Economists said it appeared the government had already\nstepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from\nother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than\nexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.\n    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German\nIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987\ntax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the\nWest German government in November.\n    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.\nBut coupled with other factors such as waning foreign\nspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long\nterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.\n    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to\nincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.\n    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in\n1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.\n    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased\nborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he\nwas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as\nraising indirect taxes.\n    But few economists believe the government will be able to\ngo through with its tax measures without increasing net\nborrowing.\n    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was\nwrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986\ncould be managed without increasing deficits.\n    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed\na large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final\nquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.\n    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of\nthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion\nmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it\nhad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Your\nvote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).\"\n    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and\nwestern Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with\nother parties in other prefectures.\n    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,\nsaid he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local\nelections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party\naffiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Dawkins said he sees\nthe round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further\nmeaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore\nconfidence in the multilateral system.\n    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups\nestablished in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September\nin Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but\nit is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these\nprocesses.\n    \"We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on\nstandstill and rollback are carried into practice.\"\n    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global\ntrading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during\nthe negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,\nhe said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Details of\nthe previous investment laws were not immediately available.\n    Somalia opened its economy to private investment in the\nearly 1980s but few foreign firms have put money into the\ncountry.

The whole refinery\nwas closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the\nmain units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.\n    But there was extensive damage to the central part of the\n32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to\ngasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.\n    The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a\nresult of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product\nfrom other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam,\na 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd\nplant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.\n    He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was\nkilled, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.\n    The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of\nits capacity since the end of January while an extensive\noverhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where\nthe hydrocracker is sited, he said.\n    This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but\nthis is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.\n    Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare\nline at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman\nsaid this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against\n105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but\ntotal sales were below target, Woolworths said.\n    The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit\nfor the year to cover mark-downs on stock.\n    Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the\nsale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for\nreorganising the Big W chain.\n    Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W.

The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000\nnew 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400\nfrancs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.\n    The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2\nbillion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.\nThese include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products\nmaize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes\nsaid.\n    Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of\nCorn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French\nplant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West\nGermany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands\nand Denmark.\n    Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the\ninstallations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the\nHaubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes\nsaid.\n    If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and\ndeveloping two other French plants, either in the maize or\nwheat starch sector.\n    Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion\nfor its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its\ncapital increase.\n    Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of\nBeghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,\nhas been holding talks with other European companies on\npossible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be\nintroduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But\nin the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided\nthat rainfall between now and June is not less than average,\nAWF said.\n    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back\nwheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they\nneeded cash flow and there were problems with alternative\ncrops.\n    \"The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and\noats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a\nhigh proportion of growers' income,\" AWF said.\n    AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87\nproduction in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts were\nnot given for the new wheat year)\n                   Area         Crop\n             1987/88  1986/87  1986/87\n Queensland    0.82     0.82     0.95\n N.S.W.        3.07     3.17     4.40\n Victoria      1.53     1.63     3.25\n S.Australia   1.45     1.64     2.30\n W.Australia   3.53     4.46     5.60\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The solution of the world's debt\ncrisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of\nprotectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the\nFederal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.\n    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner\nBank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's\nsuspension last month of part of its interest payments would\nlead to a chain reaction in Latin America.\n    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor\ncountries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from\nexports to repay foreign debt, he said.\n    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but\nBrazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of\nappropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring\nback financial stability to that country.\n    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken\nnow. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to\nrepay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions\nimproved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen\nthe economic position of these countries, to ensure world\neconomic growth so they are able to sell their products at\nadequate prices.\n    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in\ncoordination with governments, international organisations such\nas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and\ncreditor banks.\n    \"This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks\nalone,\" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing\nof debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise\nfunds on international credit markets again. He said a whole\nset of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the\ninternational banking system would provide more funds, but the\nproblem is not just economic but also political.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

For the coming months they expect export\nprospects to dim and production to fall, it added.\n    Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand but\nthey increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.\n    The business climate in the capital goods industry was\nunchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said this\nwas due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercial\nvehicles.\n    Demand in the capital goods sector was generally described\nas weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had been\nin January, the institute said.\n    The business climate in the consumer durables sector\nremained above the industry average in February. Carmakers were\nagain positive about current business but forecast a slight\nworsening of business conditions in the near future.\n    In the consumer goods industry business conditions were\ndescribed as favourable in February.\n    A small cutback in production meant orders on hand in this\nsector rose compared with January, the institute said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is\nunder close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow\nBrazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,\nPrime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.\n    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an\ninterview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.\n    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would\ncontinue to do so, but he said creditors and international\ninstitutions should show more \"understanding\" for Yugoslavia's\nsituation.\n    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had \"understanding\" for what Brazil\nhad done.\n    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging\nexports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed\npartial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread\nstrikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army\ncould be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was\nthreatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with\nhard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a\nrecord 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its\noverall debt by 996 mln dlrs.\n    Government ministers told reporters last week they\nregretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the\ncost to the economy had been too great.\n    Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos\nMilosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign\nMinister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, \"radical changes\" in\ninterest rates and repayment times were needed.\n    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those\nof his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen\nahead in financing the debt repayments.\n    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered\nby the Paris club at the end of this month.\n    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed\nthe Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be\nalarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here\nand the possibility of balance of payments problems later this\nyear.\n    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected\nto figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor\nHelmut Kohl.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It's\nextremely strong,\" he said.\n    \"As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged\nhere in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading\nsystem, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)\ngoes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path\nthat the world did in the late 1930s,\" he said.\n    While relative exchange rates had a role to play in\ndefusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer\nany solution, he said.\n    \"You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,\nbut it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's\nfar more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of\nit requires a comprehensive approach,\" Baker said in the\ninterview.\n    Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to\nadjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their\nbarriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any\ncountries.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Both sides in the IMF debate say the course\nthey favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.\n    \"We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, if\nnecessary going to the IMF,\" Mario Amato, president of the Sao\nPaulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.\n     An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very\ndifficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm\nindications such a policy reversal is in the offing.\n    The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance\nis Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present at\nyesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his\nabsence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present\nseized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see\nFunaro leave his job.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin\nAmerican debtor nations might damage the world economy.\n    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,\nBaker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,\ncalling it a \"dramatic, overnight solution.\"\n    \"While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some\npolitical appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in\nthe long run,\" he said.\n    The article was published to coincide with a three-day\nmeeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).\n    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third\nWorld debt.\n    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last month\ndeclared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no\nindication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting\nfears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial\ndebt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the\nU.S. Strategy.\n    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial\nbanks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since\nOctober 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.\n    \"Together with expected progress in commercial bank\ndiscussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should\nadd up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors\nin 1987,\" Baker wrote.\n    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted\nfor 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major\ndebtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell\nThird World debt at a discount to investors who then become\nstockholders in firms in these countries. \"These swaps aren't a\npanacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can\nmake progress in reducing the debt burden,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazil wants to resume interest payments\non its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible\nand is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the\npayments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor\nFrancisco Gros said.\n    Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first\nmeeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he was\nappointed last month, also promised a clear statement of\nBrazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.\n    But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was\ninconclusive.\n    The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not\ngive assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion\ndlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.\n    \"It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very far\nat the first meeting,\" one banker said.\n    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting\nhere of the Inter-American Development Bank.\n    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for\na legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank\ncredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the\nend of March.\n    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough\ncredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs\nto request a formal extension of the commitments to head off\npossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.\n    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will\nendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or\nsimply relay it without comment.\n    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's\nmeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable\nlanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.\n    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day\nrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally\nmatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.\nBankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is\nsubject to the moratorium.\n    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days\noverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on\nnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and when\nthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.\n    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter\nwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.\nOther U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.\n    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and\nsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if\nthere was a way round the problem.\n    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan\nmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could\nhappen.\"\n    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the\ncommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with\nBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the\nproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a\ntime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans\ncan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.\n    \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't\nmeet all its obligations,\" he said.\n    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting\ninflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the\npublic sector budget was in operational surplus.\n    But he said there was a need to spell out government\npolicy, especially on prices.\n    \"It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external\nreasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures\nmight be introduced.\n    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the\nbanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed\nby the country's creditors.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Our\nfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us\nall,\" Moore said.\n   \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last\nhope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another\nchance before the year 2000,\" he added.\n    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade\nsince the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are \nalso part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.\n    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have\nbeen particularly successful, with northern hemisphere\ncountries managing to have service industries such as banking\nand insurance included in the next full round.\n    The southerners' goal of including agricultural and\ntropical products also was met.\n    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is\ndescribed by participants as informal and no declaration is\nexpected.\n    Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political\nurgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"\n    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to\npeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the\nbenefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation\nwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"\n    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations\nincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.\n    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter.\n    American sources say he is ready to state that the best way\nto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to\nimplement four key Uruguay proposals:\n    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;\n    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT\nregulations;\n    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called\nintellectual property such as trademarks, patents and\ncopyrights;\n    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92\nmember states.\n    Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade\nMinister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks\nfor domestic political reasons.\n    Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French\ndelegation.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing\nBoard (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two\nmonths due to a bottleneck in export shipments and\nadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.\n    The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the\nequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and\nprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present export\nrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.\n    The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the\neconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of\nUganda's total exports.\n    The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January\nfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments of\ncoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.\n    These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in\nUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan\nwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and\nTanzanian railway systems, the sources said\n    Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly\nacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to\nlocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for\nmoving exports.\n    Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze\nwould be resolved in two weeks.\n    However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between\nthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out\nof action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh\ndelays in cargo movements.\n    Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption\nof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned\ntheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.\n    Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB\nwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.\n    These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's\nexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)\ncrop, the sources said.\n    According to the sources, the board's financial problems\nhave been aggravated by long delays in processing export\nreceipts.\n    The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle\nexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereas\nexport bills handled by local banks took half that time to\nprocess, they said.\n    The sources said the CMB's price structure had been\novertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially\nestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further\ndisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.\n    \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months\nbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the\nsooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the\nbetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" one\nof the sources said.\n    The government is currently negotiating a package of\neconomic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary\nFund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to\nhelp Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political\nstrife.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazil's attempt to seek better\nterms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is\nresponsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan's\nCouncil of Economic Advisers said.\n    \"I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its\ndebt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a\nresponsible request on their part,\" economist Martin Feldstein\nsaid at a weekend news conference.\n    \"It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but\nrather modest additional amounts.\"\n    Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral\nCommission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business\nand government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.\n    Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third\nWorld debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additional\ncredit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and\ninternational agencies.\n    \"Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remain\nconstant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in\nBrazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in\nthe real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,\" he said.\n    Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt\nproblems were less serious than those faced by the\ninternational monetary system in 1983 and 1985.\n    However, the European representative on the task force,\nHerve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank\nPLC, disagreed.\n    He called the present situation more difficult and, in a\ndraft proposal included in the task force's report, suggested\nsetting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with\na fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.\n    Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was\napparent from the news conference that task force members did\nnot agree on all points in their report.\n    One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor\ncountries would need additional credit in the coming years if\nthey are to enjoy satisfactory growth.\n    Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei\nNarusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of\nToyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how\nmuch credit would be needed.\n    He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing\ninternational banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe,\nwould be to lend the money.\n    The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David\nRockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to\npromote closer cooperation among the three regions.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and\nwants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.\n    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove\nloans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings\nand resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's\ntaste.\n    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is\nexpected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a\nspeech to the bank's annual meeting today (Monday).\n    But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United\nStates has some room for compromise and also to fend off other\nchallenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to\ninnovative solutions to the debt problem.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Treasury Secretary James Baker, facing\nthe toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far, is\nexpected today to stoutly defend the strategy.\n     At an opening address to the annual meeting of the\nInter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once again\nto bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt\nrelief.\n     The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrest\ncontrol of IADB lending from Latin nations.\n     The Treasury Secretary is also expected, U.S. officials\nsay, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan\nto promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and a\nmuch-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.\n     \"We have already seen substantial progress,\" Baker said in\na Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant to\nbe a \"quick fix\".\n     But Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia have all\nceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil's interest\npayments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as a\nmajor challenge to the Baker plan.\n     Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, Brazil called an\nindefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of\ncommercial bank debt.\n     Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers last\nnight to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months of\nextremely tough negotiations.\n     The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382\nbillion dlrs of foreign debt, Latin nations have since the\nstart of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest\nand principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.\n     In addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight\nis estimated to have left the region during that time.\n     The Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, calls on\ncommercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about\n29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major\ndebtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.\n     The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its\neconomy, it can service its debt comfortably and without an\natmosphere of crisis.\n     U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been\npaid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over\n70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future \nand Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep\ndebtor-creditor negotiations afloat.\n     Baker is expected to underscore these points in his\naddress today.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "USAir Group Inc said it has amended\nits 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont\nAviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to\n9,309,394. Previously it had sought all shares.\n    In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer and\nwithdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire\nApril 3, along with the new proration period.\n    On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved\nUSAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to\nacquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to\nsell the excess within one week.\n    USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also\nthe minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of\nabout 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1\npct on a fully diluted basis.\n    The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394\nPiedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir\nwould waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation\nDepartment approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to\nbuy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's\napplication to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order\nnot being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The world's dependency on the Mideast\nas the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going\nto stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and\nsenior vice president told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap\nbetween demand and supply will widen so that the trend to\nincreasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is\ninevitable,\" McIvor said.\n    Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are\nnot likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.\n    McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil\nand gas exploration and production said that dependence would\nresult from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when\nthe rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.\n    \"Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25\nbillion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only\nabout 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.\n    \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the\nremaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is\nproducing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.\n    McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered\nso far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained\nabout 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"\n    McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not\nbelieve there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with\nreserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which\nwould change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.\n    \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle\nEast. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20\nyears and only two of these lie outside the middle east\n(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope).\" McIvor said.\n    McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.\nlike Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a\npeak and would soon begin to decline.\n    But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty\nof opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the\nMiddle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and\nAustralia and Africa.\n    McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those\nareas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher\nprice of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the\ncompanies.\n    \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a\nconstant change in policies,\" McIvor said.\n    McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to\nincrease exploration as these only benefit one part of the\neconomy at the expense of other parts of the economy.\n    Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy\nSecretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he\ncould not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance\nnow but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has\nhighlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the\nneed to increase U.S. production.\"\n    McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a\ngreater role in the future in meeting energy needs.\n    \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an\nincreasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,\"\nMcIvor said.\n    \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation\nfuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an\nindustrial fuel,\" he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Its\nmajor trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion\ndlrs.\n    If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed by\nFinance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank Governor\nAbdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French export\ncredit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said.\n    An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resume\ninsurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in\n1983.\n    The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of the\ndemands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's\nestimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which\nagreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and a\nsteering committee representing the commercial banks.\n    The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised\nbecause of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate in\nthe agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by senior\nNigerian officials and representatives of the steering\ncommittee.\n    The entire package also is being held up because of the\nneed to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term\ninsured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful that\nan accord will be struck by May 31.\n    The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors'\nclaims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of\nletters of credit contained in the commercial bank\nrescheduling.\n    Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resume\ncover fairly soon as this could encourage other official\ncreditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.\n    Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt\nreschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh\nexport credits this year from official export credit agencies.\n    British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down\nfrom 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, which\ndo not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to\nsalvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -\nsending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its\ncase and instructing its producers to cut output further.\n    \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\"\nMinistry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy\nDirector General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.\n    \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will\ncreate very serious problems.\"\n    The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to\nmeet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral\nagreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed\nto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to\nincrease its imports of American semiconductors.\n    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by\nselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost\nAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory\naction.\n    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese\nchip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost\ndomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.\n    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit\ndynamic random access and erasable programmable read only\nmemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a\ncutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the\nyear.\n    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of\nchips available for export through unregulated distributors in\nthe so-called grey market.\n    \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is\ndiminishing.\"\n    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI\ncalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,\nNEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing\nspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary\nof <Texas Instruments Inc>.\n    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the\nsteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for\nU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.\n    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George\nSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.\n    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are\nexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker\nMicron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in\nHong Kong.\n    Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong\nKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but\ndenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.\n    \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We\nwill present our rebuttal,\" he said.\n    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's\nadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above\nproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.\n    He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of\nendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been\ntrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron\npublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day\nthey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who\nhad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Any shortfall during this period affects\nproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their\nstocks of seed.\n    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions\nwhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow\ntheir crops because of the favourable rains.\n    The government had distributed large quantities of seed and\nfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The award is being\ncontested.\n    The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to\ntake over American Motors.\n    American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,\nmade to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60\nmln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged\nthe award.\n    The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV>\nin 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion\ndlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General\nlast year sought protection under Chapter 11.\n    The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson\nElectric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the\ndevelopment of certain components in the contract.\n    The components were for the military's \"High Mobility\nMulti-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle\" (HMMWV), American Motors said.\n    In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to\nindemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the\nEmerson Electric claims.\n    AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,\nand faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of\nthe LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a\nconfirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The report said Latin\nAmerica continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that\nbegan in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up\nto nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.\n    The report said the region's improved economic growth last\nyear was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller\nutilization previously underused production capacity.\n    \"This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and\nbeyond because no significant new investments are being made,\"\nthe report said.\n    The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling\n3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to\n35.44 billion dlrs.\n    Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually\ndisbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.\n    To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed\n1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its\ntotal outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.\n    In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio\nOrtiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank \"will be at a\nsimilar level to last year.\"\n    He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed\nparticularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and\nenvironmental and public health, education and urban\ndevelopment. The annual report was released as the Bank's\nannual meeting is being held in Miami.\n    Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries\nwill discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan\nveto power from the current majority to 35 pct.\n    Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan\nit did not like with the assistance of only one other country.\n    The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new\nfinancing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the\nLatin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration\nto control the agency's critical loans.\n    The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power\nalthough it believes the bank's largest contributors should\nhave greater influence within the institution.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Because its novel financing deal sold\nquickly last week, General Motors Corp's <GM> General Motors\nAcceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings,\nsaid Michael Mangan of GMAC.\n    \"We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to do\nmore,\" said Mangan, director of corporate financing.\n    Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price\nlevels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small\nregional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc\nand PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.\n    \"We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,\"\nMangan said.\n    \"GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their\nthoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the\nsecurities were placed,\" the GMAC officer added.\n    Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different\npricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at\nattractive rates. \"GMAC saved some basis points with this\ntechnique,\" said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.\n    \"Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made\nsense, obviously we would not have done it,\" Mangan noted.\n    The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.\n    For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes,\nthe offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over\ncomparable Treasury securities.\n    Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield\nof 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases\nof more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20\nto yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.\n    In contrast, Ford Motor Co's <F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit\nlast month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to\nyield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.\n    \"Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,\"\nsaid an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk.\n\"They have to buy the securities in the secondary market.\"\n    Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in\nthe secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge\nnumber of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.\n    \"Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their\nholdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them,\" said\none trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors\nwould gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries\nif they could buy debt issues at or below par.\n    \"The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail\ninvestors,\" commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities\nthat were aimed at the retail sector.\n    \"Access to retail investors was the driving force behind\nthe multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to\nspeak,\" Mangan said.\n    \"There is a lot of GMAC paper out there,\" the executive\nadded, referring to the unit's past offerings. \"One of our\nbasic strategies is to target securities to specific investors\nand hopefully attain a broader distribution.\"\n    Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were\nselling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out\nby Friday afternoon.\n    \"In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions,\nyou have to make a lot more telephone calls,\" an investment\nbanker pointed out.\n    Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with\nco-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong\nretail bases. \"They can carve out a niche here,\" one said.\n    \"We plan to underwrite more of these deals,\" said a Korth\nofficial. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.\n    Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on\nWall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm\nunderwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for\nCiticorp <CCI>.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth in\nOctober 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different\nprice levels.\n    \"But the price gap between the first and second tier was\nlarge,\" Mangan said. In our conversations with the\nunderwriters, we thought three different tiers would make more\nsense because the prices would not be far apart.\"\n    Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bid\ncompetitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refunding\nmortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co <PE>.\nNon-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 by\nMoody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's.\n    Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC>,\nwill hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serial\nequipment trust certificates. The debt is rated a top-flight\nAAA by both Moody's and S and P.\n    IDD Information Services said the 30-day corporate visible\nsupply rose to 3.98 billion dlrs from 3.28 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to\ndecay, perhaps within the next 10 years,\" Nakasone told\nsupporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide\nvote since the LDP's general election victory last July.\n    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to\nfight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in\nthe tax reform package, and are now challenging the\nLDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.\n    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the\nLDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the\nsales tax as it stands.\n    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over\nthree weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would\ntake the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next\nJanuary, into consideration when they vote.\n    Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said\nin a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the\ntax \"The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your\nvote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it).\"\n    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and\nwestern Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with\nother parties in other prefectures.\n    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,\nsaid he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local\nelections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party\naffiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nhe was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank with other member nations.\n    In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of\nthe IADB, Baker said, \"We are making progress in negotiating\nreforms.\"\n    And he added that if succesful, Washington would be ready\nto put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB\nfour-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.\n    It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the\ncapital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such\na capital increase.\n    But Baker's statement that he had made progress in\nnegotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's\npolicy making board of governors at which the reform issue was\nput off until next June because of deep differences between\nWashington and Latin borrowing countries.\n    Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of\nthe bank's useable financial resources.\n    Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in\nIADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American\ncountries.\n    But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote\nand frequently approve loans to which economic reform\nconditions are not tied.\n    Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct\nof the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the\nvote.\n    Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions\nfor itself and other creditor countries.\n    \"In view of this imbalance we don't believe it is\nunreasonable to ask for a change,\" Baker said. He said the\nchanges sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a\ngreater majority of shares than a simple majority.\n    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.\nposition that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.\n    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker\nsaid he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.\ndebt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,\nopen markets and a reduced government role in the economies of\ndebtor nations.\n    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a\nmajor program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor\ncountries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms\nin those areas of their economies.\n    Such reforms would include, among other things, more\nconcern for natural resource management.\n    Baker said this lending should help debtors make a\ntransition to more open economies and freer markets.\n    He also said the bank could double its current lending\nvolume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the\npoorest nations.\n    The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve\nits analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening\nits process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations.\nHe urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker\nsaid, \"We simply believe that more discretion and policy\ninfluence should lie with the parties which contribute the\nlion's share of resources.\"\n    He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the\nReagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB\nand other multilateral development banks.\n    Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the\nbest of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if\nCongress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat\nfrom 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down\nslightly from a year ago, it said.\n    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a\nreturn to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which\nretailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and\ntime large shipments for the second half, it said.\n    Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing\nlast year's, bookings are \"very good\" for orders on several of\nits new product introductions for 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F>\nexpects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987\nearnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record\nlevels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.\n    He told the annual news conference that possible credit\nrisks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had\nlargely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore\nunlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.\n    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from\n222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit\nincreased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.\n    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business\nhad declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous\nyear. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased\nslightly and stood around 0.7 pct.\n    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business\nhad risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.\n    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln\nmarks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.\n    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which\nexcludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed\ntwo pct to 671 mln marks.\n    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5\nbillion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.\n    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage\nbusiness and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.\n    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business\nvolume rose to 46 pct from 45.\n    Hackl said that in January and February this year, the\nbank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the\nsharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own\naccount had increased in the first two 1987 months compared\nwith the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Treasury Secretary James Baker urged\ncommercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third\nworld debt burden.\n    \"I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative\nideas for reducing the debt burden,\" Baker told the annual\nmeeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.\n    But he said that he was confident banks would make\n\"substantial new lending\" to the major debtors this year.\n    He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to\ngrow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate of\ngrowth since 1980.\n    Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making \"substantial\nheadway\", Baker said import volumes of debtor countries are\nforecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost\nfive pct -- the best performance in three years.\n    He also said economic growth has kept pace with or\nsurpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors\nsince 1983.\n    \"This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one,\" the\nTreasury Secretary said, and he urged the audience of Western\nand Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against\nsuggestions of solutions like debt relief.\n    While such ideas have political appeal, Baker said, they\nwould mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.\n    And even if free market reforms followed, debt fogiveness\nwould frighten away investors who would not \"risk their capital\nin a country which abandoned its obligations.\"\n    And he said, \"A debt forgiveness plan that damages\ncommercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial\nstability.\"\n    He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a\n\"gradual and painstaking\" process, varying from country to\ncountry.\n    Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy, Baker said attitudes\nin debtor nations have changed and there is much greater\nacceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.\n    Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflation\nprograms. Others, like the Philippines and Chile, are\nprivatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.\n    The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile,\nhave committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major\ndebtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have\nrescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the\nParis club, while commercial banks are making new loans.\n    Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70\nbillion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile,\nVenezuela and Mexico.\n    Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progress\nindustrial nations are making in promoting moderate global\ngrowth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade\nimbalances.\n    He maintained world economic conditions were \"continuuing to\nimprove\" a development that would provide a positive backdrop\nfor debtor nations.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It is projecting a current account\ndeficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.\n    It estimates export earnings will have dropped by 7.1\nbillion dlrs between 1985-87 as a result of falling commodity\nprices.\n    Argentina, owing 50 billion dlrs, is Latin America's fourth\nbiggest debtor.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Operation of the plant, to be jointly\nowned by Amselco and Nerco, is set to start in October.\n    The Alligator Ridge Mine is jointly owned by Amselco and\nNerco, a unit of Nerco Inc <NER>, which is 90.5 pct owned by\nPacificorp <PPW>, a Portland, Ore., holding company.\n    The mine has produced about 60,000 ounces of gold a year\nsince 1981 using another leaching process, a BP spokesman said.\nThe open pit oxide ore reserves of Alligator Ridge will be\nexhausted by August 1987, as expected, when the work force will\nbe reduced to about 72 from 127, the company said.\n    The employees remaining after that will operate the new\nplant, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He gave\nno details and Industry Ministry officials had no immediate\ncomment.\n    Warning that high technology exports were rapidly losing\nworld market share, Chirac urged private sector industry to\nstep up its research efforts.\n    Private sector research and development spending, at 1.3\npct of Gross Domestic Product, was below the 1.8 to 1.9 pct of\nGDP spent in the U.S., West Germany and Japan, he said.\n    France awarded only 12,000 registered patents in 1986,\ncompared with 20,000 in Britain, 30,000 in West Germany, 60,000\nin the U.S. And more than 200,000 in Japan, he said. In the\nU.S. Market, France was awarded 2,000 patents last year,\nagainst 6,000 awarded to German and 11,000 to Japanese firms.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The company will inform doctors within one\nweek if a patient meets enrollment criteria and whether there\nare sufficient amounts of the drug available.\n    On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the\ndrug for wide clinical use. The drug is not a cure for AIDS,\nbut it does prolong the lives of certain people with AIDS, who\nhave a history of certain types of pneumonia, and patients with\nan advanced form of AIDS-related complex whose immune systems\nhave declined after infection with the virus.\n    The company said it only has enough supply of the drug to\ntreat 15,000 patients and by the end of the year should have\nenough supply to treat 30,000 patients.\n    Dreyer said physicians can call 1-800-843-9388 for\ninformation about distribution of the drug, and pharmacists can\ncall 1-800-322-1887 to place orders for the drug.\n    Dreyer added this distribution system will end once an\nadequate supply of the drug is available.\n    Thomas Kennedy, vice president of corporate affairs,\ndeclined to comment on the cost of developing the drug.\n    Some organizations have criticized the high cost of the\ndrug, which is said to be between 7,000 and 10,000 dlrs per\nyear for treatment. Dreyer said it took seven months to make\nthe drug, and the company obtained the principal raw material\nfrom Pfizer Inc <PFE>.\n    Dryer said the company is developing other suppliers.\n    The company said it spent 80 mln dlrs for the raw materials\nfor the drug and an undisclosed amount on research, but would\nnot disclose the total cost of developing Retrovir.\n    Burroughs has cited the high cost of making the drug as one\nof the reasons for its cost.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Yugoslavia's\nhard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.\n    Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticised\nYugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having real\ninterest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability to\ncontrol monetary policy and slow pace of reform.\n    He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMF\ncommission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.\n    \"We cannot accept this assessment because we have made not\ninconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even though\nwe are aware of our own weaknesses,\" Zemljaric said.\n    He said the report favourably assessed some trends in the\nYugoslav economy but did not say which.\n    Milos Milosavljevic, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said\nlast Friday that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of\nprincipal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far in 1987.\n    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a\nrecord 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986.\n    In an interview with the West German weekly magazine Der\nSpiegel, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic said last weekend\nYugoslavia had repaid 28.3 billion dlrs in principal and\ninterest between 1981 and 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A report by the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) concluded that index trading was not\nto blame for the two-day stock market drop that occurred Sept.\n11-12, 1986\n    The report, made public today, concluded that index trading\nmagnified but was not the cause of last fall's two-day\n120-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.\n    The commission staff said it planned to continue to closely\nmonitor developments in index-related trading but planned no\nimmediate regulatory action as a result of the precipitous\nstock market decline.\n    \"The magnitude of the September decline was a result of\nchanges in investors' perceptions of fundamental economic\nconditions, rather than artifical forces arising from\nindex-related trading strategies,\" the report said.\n    \"Nevertheless, index-related futures trading was\ninstrumental in the rapid transmission of these changed\ninvestor perceptions to individual stock prices, and may have\ncondensed the time period in which the decline occurred.\"\n    The SEC staff concluded its study \"does not provide an\nindependent basis to conclude that radical regulatory or\nstructural changes are necessary at this time.\"\n    The report said \"the dramatic growth in the size and\ninstitutional use of index products requires continued careful\nanalysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market as\nwell as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in the\nindex products and their component stocks.\"\n    It said there \"may be merit\" to requiring additional\nreporting and record keeping procedures for index-related\ntrading. But it added that the SEC staff has not yet considered\nthe costs and benefits of the various alternatives.\n    The report does not deal with a second precipitous dip in\nthe market which occurred Jan. 23.\n    On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 115\npoints in little more than an hour.\n    The SEC said its staff was still analyzing the underlying\ncauses of that price decline and had not yet made findings.\n    The SEC study was made after a number of investors, news\nreports and other analysts blamed the Sept. 11-12 drop on\nso-called \"program trading,\" in which computers rapidly execute\ncomplex trading strategies designed to profit from minute\nchanges in the relationship between the price of stock index\nfutures and the stocks that make up the index.\n    The investors and analysts complained that such rapid\nmovements in the stock market would drive small investors out\nof the market and possible even lead to a stock market crash.\n    But the SEC report said the possibility of a market\ncollapse was \"remote.\"\n    It said it believed any rapid stock price decline \"likely\"\nwould eventually be reversed by renewed buying as prices\nreached far lower levels.\n    It also argued that index futures and options are important\nto traders who use them to hedge their market positions and\nlessen risk exposure.\n    \"While a 'cascade effect' may be possible as a result of\nindex-related trading, it did not ocur on Sept. 11 and 12,\" the\nreport concluded.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro\nBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state\ngrain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import\ntenders open to private traders.\n    Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted\nto the tenders.\n    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the\nEuropean Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC\n(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced\nby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.\n    Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's\ncivil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month\nthat EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,\nin tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.\n    As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March\n12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.\n    Barreto said, \"My objective is put EPAC into the tenders\nbecause it has a right to take part.\" He added the government\nwould be studying the court order to see whether or not the\nruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.\n    Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,\nwhether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders\nhad argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the\nPortuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.\n    \"There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,\"\nBarreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had\naccepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.\n    The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in\nthe public tenders was unfair competition and violated the\nclauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the\ngradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment\nto one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting\nrequirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice\nproducers, an aide said.\n    Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of\ntheir base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their\ndeficiency payments.\n    Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against\nmaking any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of\nfear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to\nbudget-cutting pressures.\n    Representatives of these farm groups have said they also\nfear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a\nbill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for\nsharply higher support prices.\n    However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, told\nReuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor\namendment but to bring it through the committee.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc said it has filed\na motion with the Texas Court of Appeals to supplement the\ncourt record with new evidence it has just received of alleged\nbias by Judge Anthony J.P. Farris against Texaco and its chief\ntrial lawyer in its litigation with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.\n    The company contended that the alleged bias provides clear\ngrounds for a new trial. It said the motion was filed in\nconnection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending in\nthat court.\n    Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written by\nFarris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late\n1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trial\nbegan.\n    The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosity\nagainst Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller,\ndue to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from the\ncase. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a\n10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief trial\nlawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assigned\nto him, Texaco said.\n    In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grant\nTexaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.\n    Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearing\non the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, and\nthe application will be filed on March 30.\n    The company said it will ask the court to reconsider its\ndecision on the issue of due process in light of the Farris\nletters.\n    In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billion\ndlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil's\nproposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken over\nby Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.\n    A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of the\nletters for some time but were unable to release them until now\ndue to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneys\nfrom which they were secured.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today\nlodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its\npetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.\n    The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,\nwhen AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed\nby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the\ncollapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.\nAMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.\n    The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on\nthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of\nthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.\n    The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to\nwind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association\nwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the\nwinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an\narbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner\n(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin\n\"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the\nnear future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to\nJune 8.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The United States has offered Navy\nwarships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the \nGulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship\nmissiles, U.S. defense officials said today.\n    \"We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet\nUnion about the possibility of using Soviet tankers\" to ship\ntheir oil, one of the officials told Reuters. \"But if there is\nsuperpower protection, we would rather it come from us,\" the\nofficial said.\n    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait\nhad asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most\nof them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy\nguided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now\nin the southern part of the Gulf.\n    \"We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to\nhear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,\" one official said.\n    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small\nMideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has\nmoved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk\n-- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.\n    White House and defense officials said today that massing\nof the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the\nIran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made \nanti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.\n    The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait\nand other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might\nbe affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in\nthe  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House\nspokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in\nthe U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the\ngulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.\n    But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine\nmaneuvers.\n    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to\ndiscuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever\nwas necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new\nIranian anti-ship missiles in the region.\n    \"We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the\nshipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in\nthat very vital waterway of the world,\" he said on NBC\ntelevision's \"Meet the Press.\"\n    The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed\nabout U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the\nGulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which\nrepresents American interests in Iran.\n     Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended\nto threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States\nthat any interference in the region would meet a strong\nresponse from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.\n    An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a\nbroadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that\nIran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.\n    \"In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has\nalready paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and\nhegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military\npresence in the region,\" he was quoted as saying.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Sosnoff said his <MTS\nAcquisition Corp> to date has received only a \"negligible\"\nnumber of Caesars World Inc shares in response to its 28-dlr-\nper-share tender offer for all shares.\n    Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with Pratt\nHotel Corp <PRAT> and Southmark Corp <SM> on forming a joint\nventure to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendly\ntransaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest and\nPratt and Southmark the remainder.\n    Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not\nbeing actively pursued at the presentand may or may not be\ncontinued in the future.  He said there could be no assurance\nthat a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would\nagreed to talks.  \"Several preliminary contacts with\nrepresentatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication\nthat it wishes to enter into such negotiations,\" Sosnoff said.\n    He said based on talks with staff members of gaming\nauthorities, there can be no assurance that the necessary\nregulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completed\nby the original April Three expiration date.\n    Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  The\nbid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangement\nof financing.\n    Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in Atlantic\nCity, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hotel\nand Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaign\nto acquire control of Resorts International Inc <RTA> against\nNew York developer Donald Trump.  Southmark owns about 37 pct\nof Pratt Hotel.\n    Caesars World's boasrd has urged rejection of the offer on\nthe grounds that it is inadequate and has said it would\ninvestigate alternative transactions.  Sosnoff currently owns\nabout 13.3 pct of Caesars World.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "American Telephone and Telegraph Co is\nanother illustration of a maxim already learned by several\nother huge corporations - that success in one segment of the\nelectronics industry is very difficult to translate into\nsuccess selling computers.\n    ATT is learning the hard way that all the resources and\ntechnological advances in the world can not make up for weak\nmarketing and sluggish responses to one of the most rapidly\nchanging and competitive industries.\n    Consequently, ATT will try again this week to convince the\nworld that it is serious about computers, after four years in\nthe business, by announcing a set of new products and\nshowcasing its latest computer chief, Vittorio Cassoni,\nformerly of ATT's Italian affiliate Ing. C. Olivetti and Co.\n    Industry consultants said ATT will announce a faster\naddition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivity\nproducts, a new version of its Unix software operating system\nand assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.\n    The announcements, however, hold \"minimal significance\" for\nboth ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultant\nJohn McCarthy. \"They are just never going to be a significant\nplayer in this market as long as computers play a subjagated\nrole to the (telephone) network,\" he said.\n    ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984\nand still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States,\nhas only been able to carve out a fractional share of the\ncomputer industry.\n    Last year was particularly disastrous for the company's\ndata systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating loss\nfor the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a\n1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge against\nearnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).\n    Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced its\nwork force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of\n290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computer\ndivision is particularly bad, especially since the computer\nmerged its computer and network sales forces.\n    Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300\npersonal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months of\nthe year after gaining some five pct of the market.\n    \"ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300,\" said\nconsultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. \"There\nwere no major product enhancements last year and a perception\ndeveloped in the marketplace that the product was tired.\"\n    Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressive\ncompetition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on price\nand offered more technologically advanced machines. \"I would\nhave to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum on\nthe pc side,\" said DeWitt.\n    The 3B line of minicomputers has never found great\nacceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system,\nthough loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put a\nserious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted by\nindustry giant International Business Machines Corp <IBM>.\n    By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying to\ndefuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon or\nsell off the computer division and the company turned over all\nresponsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which its\nowns a 23.5 pct stake.\n    But analysts said the company's image was dealt another\nblow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards,\nwho preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division,\nannounced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, a\nsmall developer of systems to manage networks.\n    Several other executives have also left in recent months,\nincluding John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And,\nalthough the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience\nrunning Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts\nexpressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.\n    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success\nin both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and\nit is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product\nthat does not meet those profitability goals.\n     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that\nit may not give certain products enough time to become\nestablished and customers may be reluctant to buy a product\nthat could be discontinued in a year or two.\n    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative\nview of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two\nyear goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn\naround within five years.\n    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating \"to the\nwomb, going back to our old business\" of long distance\ntelephone systems at the expense of the computer division.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Oil sources said they were not crucially\nimportant to Iran's oil export trade.\n    A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes\nflew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war\nfront.\n    It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and\nseveral Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil\nterminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.\n    Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their\noccupants and the others fled, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's\nInternational Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the\nfizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested\nsuitor.\n    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost\na point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.\nHowever, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more\nthan three mln shares.\n    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they\nsaid they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food\nrestaurant chain was impossible.\n    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.\nYet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a\nBusiness Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor\nand which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.\n    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and\nPepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither\nof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's\nofficial.\n    \"It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but\nits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" said\nDenny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.\n    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the\ncurrent market rumors.\n    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been\nskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it\nviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to become\na competitor to them.\n    \"I can't put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabody\nanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up\nWendy's stock. \"It very well could be someone's interested.\"\n    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time\nfor Wendy's to be sold.\n    \"They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've\nalways believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an\noffer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the\nright time,\" Freedman said.\n    \"If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control\nthe situation,\" Freedman said.\n    \"I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't\nthink it's worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyle\nof Smith Barney.\n    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the \"burger\nwars\" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's\n<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food\nhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store\nsales last year, analysts said.\n    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced\nbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some\nanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,\nbut it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.\n    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be\nvulnerable to a takeover.\n    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth\n14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has\nimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high\npercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.\n    \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on their\nrestaurants,\" Murren said.\n    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,\nWendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the\nfourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in seven\nquarters,\" he said.\n    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could\nbe going on with Wendy's. \"My gut feeling is something's going\nto happen. I don't know what,\" she said.\n    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs\nper share.\n    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor\nbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead\nof Pepsi.\n    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by\nPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.\nPepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "West Germany's banking authorities\nare being drawn into the currency scandal surrounding\nVolkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations in\nthe financial community widen, banking sources said.\n    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts to\nhelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud at\nVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.\n    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin also\nis considering press allegations that several banks \"parked\" open\npositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.\n    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurred\npotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involving\nthe hedging of open currency positions.\n    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bank\ncorporation would not normally attract the attention of West\nGerman banking regulators.\n    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after the\nHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.\n    \"This strict banking supervision aims to protect special\ninterests -- creditors and depositors,\" the Bundesbank spokesman\nsaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.\n    \"The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen's\nnormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area of\nthe Bundesbank,\" he said.\n    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert to\nBrunswick to help investigations into activities involving\nVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of the\nnormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.\n    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor's\nstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.\n    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved in\nallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.\n    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the close\nof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of their\ncapital and reserves in open positions.\n    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in\n1974 due to currency speculation.\n    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday that\nabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section\n1a by \"parking\" such excess open positions with VW.\n    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell the\nposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.\n    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly included\nin section 1a as still counting as open positions.\n    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in\nWest Berlin said it was following the allegations but\ninvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not been\nnamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.\n    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as an\ninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identity\nof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Brief\ndeclined comment.\n    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the banking\nregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case with\nthe assistance of the Bundesbank.\n    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does not\nhave branches outside Berlin.\n    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches in\nWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.\n    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,\nonce a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations at\nfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).\n    Currency dealers said parking excess positions with\nnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.\n    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/next\ndelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next day\nat the same rate.\n    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertake\ncurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.\n    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.\nGerman press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.\n    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have been\npossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging given\nthe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.\n    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibility\nand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and fired\nits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard \"Bobby\" Junger.\n    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony today\nmarking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes did\nnot mean any of those involved was guilty.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A dividend will then be calculated and all claims\nwill be treated equally,\" PW said.\n    PW administers the Russian Compensation Fund, which was set\nup by the Foreign Office in 1917 to oversee some 45 mln stg in\npre-revolutionary reserves for claimants of assets seized\nduring the Revolution.\n    PW, which is currently accepting applications for the\nclaims, said that to date, 2,000 bond application forms and 600\nproperty application forms have been returned.\n    Because the number of applications and bonds returned is\nincreasing rapidly, a special office where the claims are being\nprocessed will remain open beyond the close of business until\nmidnight on March 31, the deadline for claims to be submitted.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Swiss bankers announced a series of\nmeasures aimed at preventing abuses of the country's tight\nbanking secrecy laws as part of a revision of a 10-year-old\nvoluntary code of conduct.\n    The measures follow renewed controversy over the limits of\nSwiss secrecy, prompted by recent allegations that both former\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos and U.S. Officials linked\nwith the arms-for-Iran scandal had accounts here.\n    The Swiss Bankers Association said it wanted to curb the\nright of bank clients to hide their identity behind lawyers.\n    The association said it would insist that banks identify\nanyone doing cash business at the counter worth more than\n100,000 francs, down from a current 500,000.\n    Banks would continue to be required to identify their\nclients in other cases and pledge not actively to help capital\nflight, or tax fraud. They would also still face fines of up to\n10 mln francs in case of abuse.\n    \"The Bankers Association is convinced that this new\nagreement will give the banks an instrument which will\nguarantee banking secrecy and help the standing of Swiss\nbanking both home and abroad,\" the statement said.\n    The code, once approved by member banks, will go into force\non October 1. The original dates from 1977.\n    Controversy surrounding the alleged use and then freezing\nof bank accounts here linked with Marcos and with the U.S.\nArms-for-Iran scandal have again directed attention on the\nrevision of the code.\n    The recent busting of a major international drug ring also\ngave fresh evidence Swiss banks had been used for \"laundering\"\ndrug money.\n    The Banking Commission, responsible for overseeing the\nbanks, said at the end of last year it wanted a drastic\nreduction in clients' ability to hide behind lawyers and\nfiduciary agents, a proposal criticised by lawyers.\n    Steering a middle way, the association said today that\nlawyers doing banking business on behalf of clients would in\nfuture have to pledge they were not doing so merely to preserve\nthe clients' identity nor only for a short period of time.\n    Until now, lawyers have only been obliged to sign a form\npledging that their clients are not misusing their anonymity\nfor illegal purposes.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax\non transportation fuels,\" Krapels said.\n    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the\noil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price\ncontrols on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil\ncompanies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax\nincentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve\nexisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling\nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.\n    Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the\nsubcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because\nfunds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources\ncannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Slow progress in talks between Brazil and\nits major foreign creditors has increased the likelihood that\nU.S. banks will declare their loans to Brazil non-performing at\nthe end of the quarter, bankers said.\n    Several banks, citing Brazil's suspension of interest\npayments on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt\nand the absence of a coherent economic plan, have already said\nthey might take such a step, even though it would cost them\ntens of millions of dollars in profits.\n    An inconclusive meeting here March 22 between central bank\ngovernor Francisco Gros and Brazil's bank advisory committee\ncan only have stiffened that resolve.\n    A nasty row is also looming over 16 billion dlrs of trade\nand money-market lines which Brazil froze last month.\n    The legal commitment to maintain these credits runs out on\nMarch 31, and the worried talk at the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank annual meeting here is that some disgruntled\nbank will sue for repayment, raising the specter of a cascade\nof lawsuits and tit-for-tat asset seizures.\n    \"My gut feeling is that common sense will prevail. But is\nthere a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,\" one New\nYork banker commented.\n    Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world's\nlargest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock\nwaves through the financial markets. But no longer.\n    Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in\nthe immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in the\nEurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most\nsensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight\nout of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.\n    In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in\npart or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about\n150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380\nbillion.\n    Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and\nNicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.\n    The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new\nbank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as\nbanks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result,\nexposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for\nthe collapse of a major bank.\n    That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp <CCI>\nfelt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put\nBrazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days\noverdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as\na result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in\n1986 the setback would be manageable.\n    Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a\nprotracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously\nerode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other\ndebtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.\n    Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financing\nagreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, an\naccord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and a\ndeal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring could\nbe reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.\n    In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, the\nbanks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. \"All\nof us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system\n- a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also\nweakens confidence in world financial stability,\" U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.\n    Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalization\nof interest is already happening in practice and that the banks\nought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors on\nlonger-term solutions that recognize that not all the interest\ncan be paid back right away.\n    Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks from\nseriously considering adding interest to the principal of a\nloan because they would have to declare the loan\nnon-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said,\nif the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they might\nbe more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.\n    \"It's not necessarily an unfavorable development,\" Gros\nsaid when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being put\non a cash basis.\n    \"We find more room to discuss these things (innovations)\nwith European banks which have already bitten the bullet.\"\n     What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry and\nfrustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quick\nconcessions.\n    A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A federal judge and a former U.S.\nsenator are among the top contenders to replace John Shad as\nchairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC), government sources said.\n    Also on the list of possible replacements are two current\nSEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.\n    Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S.\nambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequently\nplaced on the short list of Shad's possible successors were\nKevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, who\nserved about eight months in the Senate in 1981.\n    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New York\ninvestment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was an\ninterim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) after\nWilliams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy was\nSEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.\n    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may be\nunwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in Vice\nPresident George Bush's presidential campaign.\n    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements for\nShad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.\n    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SEC\nappointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.\n    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose Senate\nBanking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the new\nchairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor \"would be very\nsupportive of the division of enforcement's on-going\ninvestigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would be\nsomeone who did not come directly from the industry.\"\n    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,\nto succeed L. Paul Bremer as the U.S. ambassador to the\nNetherlands.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "International Business Machines Corp,\nhit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by\nthe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick\nMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.\n    \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not\nuntil later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference\nsponsored by the investment firm.\n    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product\nintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic\nimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.\n    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in\nmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at\n149-1/2 dlrs.\n    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company\nitself, have highlighted the external economic factors\nhampering IBM's growth.\n    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding\nthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and\npointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.\n\"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said\nof DEC's line of VAX computers.\n    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible\nmid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\"\nwas supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range\nsystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.\n    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the\nIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should\nbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a\nrebound in its mid-range business.\"\n    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13\npct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth\nin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.\n    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming\nto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5\npct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will\ndrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.\n    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16\npct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin\nsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of\n51.3 billion dlrs.\n    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings\nand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product\nintroductions in the mid-range area.\n    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to\nDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were\ncatering largely to existing customer bases, rather than\nstealing market share from one another.\n \n Reuter\n\u0003",

He indicated if the\nloan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make\nU.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to\nfurther buydown the loan rate.\n    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be\nless than 4.77 dlrs per bu.\n    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the\nfarm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56\ndlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.\n    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the\n4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.\n    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on\nsoybean program changes will be the budget costs.\n    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that\nthe U.S. loan rate provides an \"umbrella\" to foreign production\nand causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.\n    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for\nsome form of income support, Amstutz said \"the competitive\nproblem is the most severe.\" He said USDA is still studying the\nsituation and \"no resolution\" has yet been found.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nleading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S.\ncompromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank.\n    In an interview with a small group of reporters, Baker said\ndiscussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resume\naround the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund in two weeks time.\n    But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would not\ndisclose, was no longer on the table.\n    \"I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I\nexpected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this\nmeeting,\" Baker said.\n    The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans\nwhich were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.\n    In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy,\nWashington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine\nbillion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the\nBank.\n    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct\nsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.\n    Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of\nhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to\nadvance it at the April meeting.\"\n    A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective\nfour-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.\n    The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion\ndlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callable\ncapital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place\nin practice, U.S. officials explained.\n    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct\nsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.\n    Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with\na loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual\nveto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.\n    But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at one\npoint ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5\npct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that would\namount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin\nAmerican positions.\n    Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of\nhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to\nadvance it at the April meeting.\"\n    Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and\nArgentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept the\nplan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, but\nhe added, \"It's possible the proposal could be revived.\"\n    U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said they\nbelieved a decision was not forthcoming because several top\nLatin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual\nmeetings here.\n    And one official added that the key Latin officials would\nbe present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World\nBank.\n    The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left\nunresolved \"we can't look towards a greater (capital)\nreplenishment here.\"\n    That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral\ndevelopment bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehicle\nfor lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor\nnations.\n    The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than\nsectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has\nnever fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "American Express Co said its board\napproved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit.\n    American Express also approved the previously announced\nplan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of\nthe unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The\npreferred shares are convertible to the same number of common\nshares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.\n    American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of\nthe 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.\n    American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that\nAmerican Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson\nuntil January, 1999.\n   American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held\nby certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson\nstock ownership plan to be formed.\n    American Express said it anticipates a registration\nstatement for the public offering will be filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission shortly.\n    American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split\nand raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36\ncts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to\nshareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln\nAmerican Express shares outstanding.\n    The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to\napproval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected\nin April.\n    American Express also said an agreement was reached by\nShearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in\nLondon.\n    The venture will focus on investment advisory asset\nmanagement, market research and consulting on financing. It\nalso said it expects the relationship to extend to selected\nprojects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon\nLife in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to\nfuture personnel exchanges.\n    Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative\npreferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative\npreferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to\nan equal number of common shares following the U.S. government\napprovals.\n    American Express said that assuming conversion of the\npreferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson\nLehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public\noffering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment\noption to purchase 1.8 mln shares.\n    American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year\nwarrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at\n100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American\nExpress shares outstanding.\n    Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to\nthe Shearson board and one representative to serve as an\nadviser to the American Express board of directors.\n    \"These proposed transactions are yet another signal that\namerican express intends to stay in the forefront of the\nfinancial services industry worldwide,\" said American Express\nChairman James D. Robinson. \"The implementation of our plans,\nmoreover, will enable us to maintain a majority interest in\nshearson while enhancing the strength of our balance sheet by\ntapping additional capital resources for shearson outside\namerican express.\"\nReuter...\n\u0003",

        "body": "Foreign currency futures\nmarkets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries\nagreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,\nsaid Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange's, CME, executive committee.\n    \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at\nall.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy\nmarket,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a\nfour pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency\nfluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to\nmake each contract a larger value.\"\n    As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental\nin the development of currency futures, which now are crucial\nto the Chicago exchange.\n    Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can\napproach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by\ngovernments to control currency fluctuations.\n    \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an\nhour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's\nunrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\"\n    The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the\nexchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock\nindex futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would\nhelp eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity\nmarkets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day.\n    \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a\nsalutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think\nthis issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change\nin the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to\ngo into effect, he said.\n    Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders\nof the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would\naddress complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.\n    Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring\nbrokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own\naccount. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in\ndual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to\nthe nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.\n    The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect\non the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very\ninstrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said,\npredicting the increase would come within a year.\n    Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said\nthe CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit\non the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could\nnot be a temporary program.\n    The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more\nthan we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission\nmerchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event\nthe price approached the bottom limit.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture\nof GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set up\nlast June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss\nof about 500 mln dlrs this year.\n     David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based\nSouthwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did\nnot know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed\nthat for the year the company should have about the same\nresults as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"\n     He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs\nover \"two plus years\" to set up its network.\n\n    Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln\ndlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order\nto lease its lines.\n     He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic\ntelephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are\noperable.\n     By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's\nsubscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead\nof leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the\nsecond quarter.\n    Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along\nmicroscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more\neconomical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line\nthe diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information\nas a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.\n     \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to\ncarry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland\nsaid.\n    He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.\nlong distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about\n10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.\n     Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than\nATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone\nexchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the\ncompanies have equal access. He said the company was cutting\nback its advertising by about 30 pct this year.\n     At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total\nnumber of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to\nlast January.\n    \"We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance\nof it,\" he said.\n     Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he\nbelieved ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be\nregulated on pricing plans.\"\n     \"They're so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding\nthat ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition\nin the marketplace.\"\n     \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he\nsaid, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.\"\n    Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's\ntwo owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such\nas the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on\nthem to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.\n     \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and\ntime again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he\nwas \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be\narguing. \"There's no evidence of that,\" he said.\n     He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,\nnumber of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead\nin many areas.\"\n    Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint\ncurrently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in\n90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.\n    \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.\n    He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but\nwas working on it.\n     He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the\nforerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September\n1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone\nnetwork.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Last week, the\nWhite  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fund\nthe acid rain fight.\n    Mulroney described the commitment as \"significant,\" but noted\nit was a long time in coming.\n    \"We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go,\" Mulroney\nsaid. \"But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace with\nwhich the U.S. administration moved to implement the\npresident's acceptance of the envoy report.\"\n    The prime minister urged his mostly American audience to\nhelp Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his government\nis determined to fight on more than one front.\n    \"The campaign does not involve either or choices between the\nadministration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other,\" he\nsaid.\n    The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's call\nto take the battle to Congress.\n    \"It is clear that he has an understanding now that Congress\nmust be emphasized as equally as the administration,\" said\nspokesman Michael Perley.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

They are now at 10\npct.\n    Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British\nreserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England\nintervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the\nauthorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and\nOctober 1986, government sources said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47\npct said production would likely remain unchanged.\n    The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting\nproduction to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was\nthe highest such figure recorded since 1977.\n    In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected\na rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain\nat present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.\n    The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies\nconsider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct\nview them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below\nnormal.\n    This was the highest positive balance since the question\nwas first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.\n    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct\nrespectively.\n    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of\nall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to\nbe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only\n23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.\n    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below\nnormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,\nthe proportion of companies rating their export books above\nnormal was unchanged between February and March.\n    On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies\nexpect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will\nremain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in\nFebruary.\n    From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect\nprices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall,\nagainst four pct a month earlier.\n    Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee\nchairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive\nlevel against many European currencies had improved exports.\n    \"But interest rates are still much higher than in our\ncompetitor countries and British manufacturers will still have\nto work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and\nin the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at\nhome,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

This would help agriculture because some its\ninefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he\nsaid.\n    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the\nprocess, but it should result in a more rational system of\nworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.\n    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a\nrelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26\nbillion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more\nthan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,\nhe said.\n    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in\nthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically\nrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural\ntrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to\nbe as part of a larger package.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> is\nlikely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating\nprofits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in\nits aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.\n    Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from\noperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs\ncompared with 1.23 billion in 1985.\n    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of\nabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay\nPacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May.\n    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend\nfor its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents\nadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.\n    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the\ncompany's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,\nanalysts said.\n    The company's aviation division consists of its majority\nstake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in\n<Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct\nowned by Cathay.\n    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23\nbillion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel\ncosts and greater traffic.\n    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the\nflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has\nsince slipped to 50.23 pct.\n    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits\nrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.\n    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,\nestimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.\n    \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot\nbetter in the second half of the year.\"\n    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire\nProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln\ncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs\nfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the\nsame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the\nlow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's\nproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential\ndevelopment and two luxury housing projects.\n    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in\nTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in\nsecond-half 1986.\n    During the year property prices continued to rise as more\npeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,\nanalysts said.\n    \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling\nat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year\nago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)\nLtd.\n    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in\nthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will not\nprovide income until the first stage is completed next year.\n    The company also sold three properties and a part interest\nin a proposed hotel development, which should result in\nextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James\nCapel (Far East) Ltd.\n    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected\nto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and\noffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10\nmln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It bought nearly two\nbillion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.\n    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council\nfor Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising\nreserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"\n    He said the government expects heavier pressure from the\nU.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against\nnations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses\nwith the U.S.\n    Wang said the government would launch new measures within\nthe next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open\nthe market wider to foreign products, especially those from the\nU.S.\n    Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's trade\nsurplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two\nmonths of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct\nof the surplus was with the U.S.\n    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang's\nremarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were\nrunning out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation\nfrom Washington,\" he said.\n    He said the measures would include removal of trade\nbarriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.\n    Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying\nU.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear\nthe strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.\n    He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign\nexchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls,\nbut declined to give details.\n    The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S.\nDollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S.\nDollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and\nto 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Australia's crude\noil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a\ntargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources\nand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.\n    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association\n(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a\npackage that would recognise the government's economic\npriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.\n    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review\nof oil taxation.\n    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted\napproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results\nin recent years.\n    These include the reduction in the top marginal crude\nexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September\n1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore\noil announced last September, he said.\n    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the\nelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost\nincentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices\nand Australia's relatively low exploration levels.\n    \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to\nan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour\nthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,\nwhich leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still\nleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are\ngoing to do in major areas,\" Evans said.\n    He said the government did not intend to change its\nresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before\nparliament, in response to industry calls to allow all\nexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.\n    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to\nhighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a\ncertain rate of return has been achieved for individual\nprojects.\n    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because\nexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.\n    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more\nthan anything on the government's desire to ensure the\ncertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major\ninvestments have already been planned on the existing ground\nrules.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Agriculture and services\nwere included in the negotiations for the first time.\n    The growing debt burden of Latin American and African\nnations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to\nsucceed, he said.\n    \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export\nendeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and\nthat's the basic objective of the new GATT round,\" he said.\n    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It\nwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,\nbut it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.\n    \"It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because\nthese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\"\nhe said.\n    \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round\nas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making\npossible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The companies were in the\nnon-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.\n    But industry analysts said development problems remain and\ncommercial application is still some years away.\n    \"The area clearly has significant applications but it won't\nbe commercially viable for a few years,\" said Thomas Murtha,\ntechnology analyst with James Capel and Co.\n    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could\nbring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can\nbe overcome.\n    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said\nsuperconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,\nelectricity generation and storage, and scientific research.\n    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in\na heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.\n    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T> predicted in an\nin-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth\n150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50\nbillion for those used in electricity generators and 150\nbillion for those used in electricity storage.\n    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable\nof 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered\nmainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of\nsuperconducting material would be needed for such a train.\n    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used\nin nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.\n    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial\napplications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must\nbe cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum\nelectrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,\nwhich is much less expensive, has recently also been used\nsuccessfully, they said.\n    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have\nboosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.\n    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's\nclose, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMI.T> share\nprice rose 140 yen to 485 yen.\n    In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp <MITM.T>, rose 95\nto 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd <TOMM.T> rose 200 to\n1440 yen, and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260.\n    Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares <URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to\n689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd <FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.\n    Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments\nneeded to conduct the superconductor research also rose.\n    Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor,\nmade from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently\nundergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the\nMinistry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "World Bank president Barber Conable\npledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower\nworld oil prices, but said further deregulation of its\nprotected economy was needed.\n    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,\nhe said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the\neconomy and deregulate trade policy.\n    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which\ncut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third\nWorld's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs\nfrom the World Bank in the past 20 years.\n    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300\nmln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was\nprepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to\nlower oil and primary commodity prices.\n    \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are\nconsistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" he\nsaid.\n    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last\nyear's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the\ndifficulties now faced by other countries.\n    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the\ndollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and\nhas announced a series of measures since May intended to\nstimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise\nthe economy.\n    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics\nand high tariff barriers remain in place.\n    Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met\n14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's\nborrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the\ncountry.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Industrial holding company Williams\nHoldings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary\nshares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.\n    The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams\nshares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share\n    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last\nnight of 397p.\n    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits\nof the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to\npropose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash\nalternative.\n    The offer will include a partial convertible alternative\nunder which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69\nmln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their\nordinary share allocations.\n    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one\nWilliams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a\nvalue of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.\n    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986\nrose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.\n    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in\nthe market for several months, dealers said. Initially it\ncentred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then\nswitched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.\n    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with\nNorcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which\nreplied that any benefits that could be achieved could also\nresult from normal trading.\n    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise\nin pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover\nthat lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln\n    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a\nmarket capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of\nacquisitions in the next four years has pushed its\ncapitalisation up to around 380 mln.\n    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four\nWilliams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a\nshare. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of\n400.2p a share.\n    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price\ndown to 733p from last night's close at 750p.\n    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or\n0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.\n    There was no immediate response from Norcros.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The dollar is expected to decline further\nin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of\nlast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,\nsenior foreign exchange dealers said.\n    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers\nsaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of\n147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.\nBehind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's\naccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the\ndollar down, the dealers said.\n    \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\nthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major\ncurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji\nKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury\ndivision.\n    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\nWould favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of\nintervening to support the currency.\n    \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against\npossible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said.\n    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward\nmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly\ncontain a further slide in the currency.\n    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5\nbillion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,\nand yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars\nthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York.\n    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve\nwould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but\nsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148\nyen.\n    \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the\nflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the\nAmericans don't want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market\nmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.\n    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month\nwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close\ntheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.\n    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar\nremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of\nthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and\nJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.\n    \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in\nstimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant\ngeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international\ntreasury division.\n    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of\neconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to\nboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its\ntrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on\nthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of\nparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a\nsales tax.\n    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance\nof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,\nDai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.\n    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the\nJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress\nwould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The council of the\nAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it\nwill press on with its campaign for major improvements to\nAustralia's petroleum taxation structure.\n    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly\ndisappointed by the Australian government's position on\ntaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy\nMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.\n    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target\nany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to\nsecondary taxation of petroleum.\n    APEA had expected the government to make positive responses\nto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of\nexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration and\ndevelopment, the council said.\n    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by\nEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed\nwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.\n    Evans told the conference the government did not plan to\naccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow\ndeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.\n    \"The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of\nunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore\narea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is\nprofit based,\" the APEA council said.\n    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil\nexploration companies that it had realistic answers to the\nindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's\nproblems, the council said.\n    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory\nsecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major\ndisincentives at a time of low oil prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "China's Finance Minister Wang Bingqian\nwill report a 1986 budget deficit of up to nine billion yuan\nand prescribe austerity measures for 1987 in a budget speech on\nThursday, foreign bankers and diplomats told Reuters.\n    Chinese officials have said the 1986 deficit is \"several\nbillion,\" after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followed\nsix years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuan\nshortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.\n    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in\nfixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state\nfirms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.\n    \"China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production\nwhile cutting expenditure,\" the official Peking Review said in\nan editorial yesterday.\n    \"China should institute means for the effective control of\nthe macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger\nones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and\nreduced consumption,\" it said.\n    Only by such measures, the magazine said, \"can an overall\nsupply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy\ndevelop steadily over a long period.\"\n    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,\nwhich he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in\nefficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and\ntaxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.\n    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits\nand taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to\n119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,\nlosses rose and product quality was unstable.\n    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of\nbad management and rapid changes in external conditions.\n    \"For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free\nmarket, where prices are up to double those for materials they\nbuy under fixed quota from the state,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,\nbecause they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank\nloans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.\nUnder these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the\neconomic levers the state is introducing,\" he said.\n    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand\nin the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of\nindustrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.\n    \"He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting\ngovernment expenditure,\" he said. \"China's economy is inherently\nunstable, either in a high or a trough.\"\n    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since\nthe start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting\ninvestment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to\nbring demand and supply into balance.\n    \"There will be no surprises,\" the diplomat said.\n    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was\nthe lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese\nindustrial city.\n    \"Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys\nto feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,\nwith one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.\nBut there was none on this visit,\" he said.\n    He added economic reforms will slow this year, in\nparticular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise\nsensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues\nraise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.\n    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about\neight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a\nnational drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning\nWestern political ideas.\n    \"In China the political system dictates economic policy,\" he\nsaid. \"The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat\nthe reformers and demand more economic austerity.\n    \"One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week\n1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less\noverseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be\nsourced internally.\"\n    The banker said he is more comfortable about China's\nstability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched\nafter the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.\n    \"There is no leftist alternative to the reforms,\" he said.\n\"There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.\nBut the reforms will take years. What you have now is a\nconfused mix of control and market economies.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr\npurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers\nare likely to follow, securities analysts said.\n    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses\nis likely to pay off in dollars and international market\nposition, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing\ncapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign\nfinancial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with\nKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.\n    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described\nby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give\nNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on\nWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its\nassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.\n    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business\nsectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.\n    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50\njoint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset\nmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.\n    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the\nworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.\n    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the\ndeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life\ninsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.\n    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese\ninsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.\nSince then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks\nand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and\ninstruments.\n    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was\nappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's\nboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a\nlimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and\nproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for\nblue-chip organisations,\" he said.\n    \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing\nindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a\nhistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,\nthere's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"\n    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater\nJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln\nyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17\nto 18 pct, he said.\n    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and\ngain experience with financial instruments which are likely to\nspread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory\nenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')\ndiversification. Now there's a growing number of new products\nin an environment of increasing competition for performance on\nfund management,\" Smithson said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leading Australian onshore oil and gas\nproducer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit\nby sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and\nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG).\n    The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net\nprofit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.\n    Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement\nthat increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along\nwith reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil\nexploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal\nwith an adverse business climate.\n    Santos said it remained financially strong with an\ninjection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985\nrights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the\nend of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.\n    It said it had also made significant progress in repaying\ndebts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds\nhad fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.\n    Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid\nfor the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas\ncompany <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln\ndlrs.\n    Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar\ndenominated and significant currency purchases were made during\nthe year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held\n145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.\n    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,\nfinding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil\nexploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to\nreserves -- less than depletion during the year.\n    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme\nto double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for\noil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.\n    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and\nproduction volumes but with extra oil exploration and\nencouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.\n    But it called on the goverment to continue fostering\ndomestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.\n    \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when\nexploration is at its lowest level for many years and when\nAustralia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\"\nMassy-Green said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Indonesia's September devaluation\nhelped bank profits to rise by 28.6 pct in calendar 1986, but\ndespite higher world oil prices, banks are likely to see\nprofits stabilise or fall in 1987, the head of Indonesia's\nAssociation of Private Banks told Reuters.\n    Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview that\nmost banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluation\nagainst the U.S. Dollar.\n    He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable for\nIndonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    But he forecast that overall bank profits would probably\nfall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said were\nartificially high due to the devaluation.\n    The Association's latest report on the performance of\nIndonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows that\noverall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385\nbillion in 1985.\n    This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9\nbillion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.\n    The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986,\nmostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.\n    Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp <BAC.N>, was\naffected by a string of bad debts and other problems during the\nyear. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a loss\nof 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.\n    A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of America\nin Jakarta was now back on track. \"The worst is behind us.\"\n    Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986\nfrom 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.\n    Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed to\noperate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2\nbillion in 1985, the report said.\n    These profits do not include offshore loans, which are\nhandled through other centres but which account for most of the\nforeign banks' business.\n    Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which account\nfor more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharply\nto 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.\n    Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from\n31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.\n    Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to\n63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.\n    Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552\nbillion at the end of December 1985.\n    Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgeted\ngovernment spending will fall in real terms. Many ministries\nhave had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.\n    \"This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,\"\nMuna stated. \"But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, the\ngeneral performance of the banking sector will not be too bad.\"\n    Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish,\nbut Indonesia was using more foreign loans.\n    Bank of Tokyo <BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed to\noperate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billion\nrupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But its\nprofit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.\n    Citicorp's <CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listed\nas the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behind\nBank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a\n1985 profit of 11.9 billion.\n    A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was a\nbook-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, but\ndeclined to give further figures.\n    One western banker said that \"Citibank is still definitely\nthe largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not its\nprofit figures show it.\"\n    Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms of\nassets of all banks in Indonesia.\n    The government allows only 11 foreign banks to conduct full\nbanking operations, and restricts their business to Jakarta.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Canadian Trade Minister Pat\nCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world\ninternational trade and should therefore become more price\nresponsive over time.\n    She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade\nministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted\nadopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture\nshould avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries\nshould freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that\ndistorted world prices, Carney said.\n    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should\nnot introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing\nlegislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must\nbe implemented collectively.\n    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are\nbasically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals\nannounced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.\n    European trade sources said the conference welcomed the\nCanadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the\nEuropean Community, voiced reservations about some of the\nprinciples.\n    Carney said there was a lot of political will among the\nministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under\nfour years and that there is also a realisation that it has to\nbe done in a balanced way.\n    \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a\nbroad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early\nconclusion,\" she said.\n    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,\nCarney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade\nnegotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by\nOctober, are progressing well.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Somehow it has been the\nperception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich\ncountries,\" he added in an interview with Reuters.\n    \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for\ndiscussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be\nof more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said.\n    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the\nUruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the\nworld trade system.\n    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of\ntrade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery\nto make it more responsive.\n    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but\nfaced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very\nhigh duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South\nKorea as examples.\n    He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New\nZealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to\nencourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted\nthat New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Barbados is making its annual trip to\nthe international capital markets a bit earlier this year and\nhas mandated Barclays Bank Plc to arrange a 25 mln stg\nrevolving credit, Barclays said.\n    The financing will be for seven years, with four years\ngrace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in U.S.\nDollars. The credit will be transferable and carry interest at\n1-1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. There is a\ncommitment fee of 1/2 pct.\n    Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50\nbasis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.\n    The terms represent an improvement over those obtained last\nyear, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlr\ntransferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity but\nhad interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility was\nsubsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.\n    However, the loan was not signed until November 5, and\nbankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have the\nfinancing in place early to give it greater flexibility in\ndrawing the funds over the course of the year.\n    Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowings\nwith a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.\n    At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox,\nadvisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking to\nmake greater use of the international capital markets to reduce\nthe country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.\n    However, bankers believe this will be the country's only\nmajor financing for this year, although another small private\nplacement in Japan could be arranged later in the year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It did not provide figures for 1986.\n    The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturing\ninvestment on the uncertain outlook for demand in those\nindustries.\n    The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking and\nshipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance and\nrepair costs for their facilities and equipment.\n    In non-manufacturing industry, growth in investment is\nexpected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retail\nstore area, 12.4 pct, as new department stores and supermarkets\nare built and old ones are remodelled.\n    The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporate\ninvestment that would help restructure the Japanese economy and\nurged government deregulation and other action to offset this.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Of\nall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to\nbe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only\n23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.\n    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below\nnormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,\nthe proportion of companies rating their export books above\nnormal was unchanged between February and March.\n    On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies\nexpect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will\nremain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in\nFebruary.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This would help agriculture because some its\ninefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he\nsaid.\n    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the\nprocess, but it should result in a more rational system of\nworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.\n    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a\nrelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26\nbillion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more\nthan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,\nhe said.\n    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in\nthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically\nrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural\ntrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to\nbe as part of a larger package.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The dollar is expected to decline further\nin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of\nlast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,\nsenior foreign exchange dealers said.\n    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers\nsaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of\n147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.\nBehind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's\naccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the\ndollar down, the dealers said.\n    \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\nthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major\ncurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji\nKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury\ndivision.\n    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\nWould favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of\nintervening to support the currency.\n    \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against\npossible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said.\n    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward\nmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly\ncontain a further slide in the currency.\n    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5\nbillion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,\nand yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars\nthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York.\n    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve\nwould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but\nsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148\nyen.\n    \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the\nflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the\nAmericans don't want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market\nmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.\n    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month\nwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close\ntheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.\n    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar\nremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of\nthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and\nJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.\n    \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in\nstimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant\ngeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international\ntreasury division.\n    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of\neconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to\nboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its\ntrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on\nthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of\nparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a\nsales tax.\n    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance\nof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,\nDai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.\n    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the\nJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress\nwould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr\npurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers\nare likely to follow, securities analysts said.\n    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses\nis likely to pay off in dollars and international market\nposition, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing\ncapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign\nfinancial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with\nKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.\n    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described\nby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give\nNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on\nWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its\nassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.\n    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business\nsectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.\n    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50\njoint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset\nmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.\n    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the\nworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.\n    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the\ndeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life\ninsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.\n    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese\ninsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.\nSince then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks\nand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and\ninstruments.\n    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was\nappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's\nboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a\nlimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and\nproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for\nblue-chip organisations,\" he said.\n    \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing\nindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a\nhistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,\nthere's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"\n    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater\nJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln\nyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17\nto 18 pct, he said.\n    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and\ngain experience with financial instruments which are likely to\nspread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory\nenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')\ndiversification. Now there's a growing number of new products\nin an environment of increasing competition for performance on\nfund management,\" Smithson said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Canadian Trade Minister Pat\nCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world\ninternational trade and should therefore become more price\nresponsive over time.\n    She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade\nministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted\nadopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture\nshould avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries\nshould freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that\ndistorted world prices, Carney said.\n    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should\nnot introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing\nlegislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must\nbe implemented collectively.\n    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are\nbasically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals\nannounced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.\n    European trade sources said the conference welcomed the\nCanadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the\nEuropean Community, voiced reservations about some of the\nprinciples.\n    Carney said there was a lot of political will among the\nministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under\nfour years and that there is also a realisation that it has to\nbe done in a balanced way.\n    \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a\nbroad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early\nconclusion,\" she said.\n    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,\nCarney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade\nnegotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by\nOctober, are progressing well.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The communication was sent through Switzerland, which\nrepresents U.S. Interests in Iran.\n    Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to\nthreaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in\nthe region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on\nSunday.\n    Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf\nby Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war,\nan offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

(2130 GMT), ripping a crater half a meter (1.5 feet) deep\nand three meters (nine feet) wide in the ground, and could be\nheard several kilometers (miles) away, a police spokesman said.\n    An anonymous caller, speaking English, telephoned the West\nGerman domestic news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur just before\nthe explosion and said a bomb was about to go off at the base.\n    Thatcher left Bonn early yesterday evening after talks with\nwith Chancellor Helmut Kohl ahead of her visit to Moscow next\nweek. She had flown to West Germany from talks with French\nPresident Francois Mitterrand in Normandy earlier in the day.\n    Officers of the Nato Northern Army Group, which is also\nbased at Rheindahlen, were holding a social dinner attended by\nBritish and West German servicemen and their wives inside the\nmess when the bomb went off.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\nHoare Govett bid is valued at about 210.4 mln U.S. dlrs.\n    The spokesman said the talks are the result of a change in\nOntario securities laws that takes effect June 30.\n    Currently, companies outside the Canadian securities\nindustry are prohibited from owning more than 10 pct of a\nCanadian broker.  On June 30, 1987, foreign brokers will be\nallowed to own up to 50 pct of Canadian brokers, and the\npercentage will rise to 100 pct a year later.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He declined to name the third\ncompany, since it was not clear what role it played.\n    A spokesman for the bank said he was aware of the order.\n\"Now we have to find out what is on the accounts,\" he said. He\ndeclined to give further details.\n    The SEC alleged in a New York court last week that Sofer\ntransferred 1.9 million dollars from a U.S. Bank account of the\ncompany Plenmeer to an account at Credit Suisse.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The sharp drop in the value of the\ndollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test\nof last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to\nstabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said.\n    \"The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated\ncentral bank intervention,\" one dealer for a German bank said,\nechoing widepread sentiment in the market.\n    But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged\nin Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing\nsigns the United States wanted the dollar to fall further.\n    Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar\nplunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low\nas 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they\nexpected the U.S. Currency to decline further.\n    \"The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen\nrange,\" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said.\n    Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp\ndollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanese\ncompanies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the\nend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining\nthe U.S. Currency.\n    Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not\ntechnical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the\nParis accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a\nrenewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar\ndown.\n    \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of\ncentral bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said.\n    The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5\nbillion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials\nindicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said.\nBank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank\nintervention if necessary.\n    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the\ntime had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last\nmonth to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France,\nthe U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the\npact.\n    But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were\nnot detected in the open market during the European morning.\nOpinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act.\n    While some said the West German central bank would support\nthe dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the\nBundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks\nor if the decline accelerated.\n    The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the\ndollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.\n    \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" one\ndealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and\ngovernments was easier said than done.\n    Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative\nClayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the\nverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.\n    \"It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a\ndealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what\nthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\"\n    Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for\nthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.\n    \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or\nable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the\nnecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.\n    It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks\nis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks\nor even less is expected this year.\"\n    And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987\neconomic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual,\nfall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\"\n    But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in\nforce was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should\nbe read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments.\n    \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken\ndown,\" a senior dealer said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The company said it may move AlloyTek's plant from\nGrandville, Mich., to a lower labor cost area.\n    The company said it discovered the extent of the AlloyTek\nproblems during a year-end review of subcontracts and related\nwork in progress for production of jet engine components for\nGeneral Electric Co <GE>.\n    It said it will release annual results around April 15.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.\n    A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying\na more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.\n    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.\n    \"Money supply control is the government's chief weapon\nagainst inflation,\" he said. \"The problem is higher rates are\nattracting liquidity from abroad.\"\n    He said this was why the central bank enacted specific\nmeasures to control the inflow of foreign capital.

Agriculture and services\nwere included in the negotiations for the first time.\n    The growing debt burden of Latin American and African\nnations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to\nsucceed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop their\nexport endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen\nand that's the basic objective of the new GATT round.\"\n    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It\nwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,\nbut it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.\n    \"It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because\nthese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\"\nhe said.\n    \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round\nas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making\npossible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Value added tax (VAT) and personal\nincome tax are to be introduced next year, alongside price\nreform and a modified wage system, the official Hungarian news\nagency MTI said in its Weekly Bulletin.\n    A draft act divides goods into three groups for VAT. Most\nwill be taxed at 20 pct, although basic foods, urban transport,\nfuel, pharmaceuticals and probably homes and building materials\nwill be zero-rated. Non-basic services will be taxed at 10 pct.\n    Several other taxes will be abolished when VAT comes in\nnext January 1 and the effect will be to cut producer prices by\nbetween five and 10 pct, MTI said.\n    Consumer prices will rise by about eight pct as result of\ncuts in subsidies, including those on milk and dairy products,\nMTI said. It did not say what effect the VAT would have.\n    Basic changes in company taxation were necessary as varying\ntaxes and subsidies gave a confusing picture, and minor steps\ntaken so far had only improved things temporarily.\n    MTI said inefficient firms were still being maintained at\nthe expense of efficient ones, whose profit incentive was\nblunted by an average profit tax of 80 pct. The idea was to\ngive all ventures equal chances and eliminate distinctions.\n    \"Valid preferences or supports are to be withdrawn, or at\nleast reduced,\" MTI said.\n    The tax changes will be a further step in a recent line of\neconomic reforms designed to boost company efficiency.\n    Management of 75 pct of all state enterprises passed from\nministries to elected enterprise councils in 1985 and 1986, and\na bankruptcy law in force since last September limits the duty\nof the state to save loss-making firms.\n    MTI said yesterday state subsidies to enterprises and\nindustrial cooperatives rose 16 pct last year, while profits\nrose 4.6 pct. It gave no absolute figures.\n    The number of small private ventures rose 4,000 to 39,000\nin 1986. Their turnover rose 27.5 pct and net income 16.2 pct.\nThey now employ 443,000, nine pct of the workforce.\n    Hungarians now pay no tax on their primary income, and\nrelaxation of central economic controls has led to large\ndisparities in earnings, almost entirely in the private sector.\n    MTI said the introduction of personal income tax for all\nworkers would lead to a fairer bearing of the public burden.

        "body": "The U.S. economy is showing some\npromising signs of accelerated expansion despite the\nsluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private\neconomists say.\n    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December\nperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarter\nthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in\nJanuary slowed business and consumer spending.\n    But some of the latest economic data show signs of\nsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some\neconomists remain cautious about the outlook.\n    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for\ndurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct\nrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around\na modest two pct level for the next few years.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "World Bank President Barber Conable\nlinked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's\nsixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and\ndismantle protectionist barriers.\n    \"We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the\nadjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation\nof the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a\nthree-day visit to Jakarta.\n    Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's\nhard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the\ngovernment to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.\n    The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr\ntrade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on\nthe economic policies Indonesia adopted.\n    But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto\nand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific\npolicy changes.\n    \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian\ngovernment. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly\nhit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues\nfrom crude exports in half.\n    Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning\nwith Suharto.\n    He voiced support for measures already taken, including\nSeptember's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to\nderegulate imports and stimulate exports.\n    \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in\na continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of\ntoday's world,\" he said.\n    The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the\npast 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.\n    The World Bank would probably like to see further\ndismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce\nIndonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics\nand cement, western bankers and diplomats said.\n    The government has already said it will announce further\nderegulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also\nconsidering selling off loss-making state companies.\n    Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find\nfunds to cover its share of development projects, which\notherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im\nbank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It had principally operated as a Volvo\ndealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a\ntrading and industrial company.\n    In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking\nfirm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB.

        "body": "Most of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers\nbegan an indefinite national strike, union leaders said, as the\ncountry's labour troubles showed no signs of easing.\n    A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 is\nstill continuing, despite a partial return to work.\n    A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strike\nheadquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters that\nabout 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.\n    He said that many private banks were working, particularly\nin Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.\n    The bankworkers, one of the best-organized sectors of\nBrazil's labour force, are striking for a 100 pct pay rise.\n    Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Banco\ndo Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.\n    Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse of\nthe government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.\n    According to official figures, prices rose by 33 pct in\njust the first two months of the year.\n    Other strikes are being threatened, including national\nstoppages by 450,000 social security workers and 50,000\nuniversity teachers.\n    In central Sao Paulo dozens of armed military police stood\nguard outside branches of the Banco do Brasil to preempt any\nmove by bankworkers to occupy the buildings.\n    A bank official in one foreign bank, which was still open\nthis morning, said that with the closure of the Banco do Brasil\nprivate banks would not be able to function much longer.\n    He said: \"If the Banco do Brasil closes it shuts down the\nwhole system. I think that after lunch we will have to stop.\"\n    Groups of strikers marched in the central commercial\ndistrict, waving banners and stopping outside private banks to\nchant slogans.\n    Pires said the strike call had been largely ignored by\nworkers in the private banks, with many branches open\nparticularly in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.\n    Television reports said that in the southern state of\nParana farmers protesting against high interest rates supported\nthe bankworkers.\n    As they have done many times over the past few weeks, they\nblockaded the entrances of private banks with farm machinery.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But he said it was not necessarily due to\nimprudent borrowing and \"it is still within an area of being\nmanageable.\"\n    The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts of\naround 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to a\nprojected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87\nending March 31.\n    Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.\n    Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the rise\nin the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio by\nreducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.\n    Indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes up\nalmost one third of the 1987/88 budget.\n    Payment on the principal of government debts is officially\nprojected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billion\nin 1986/87.\n    Conable linked an increase in World Bank lending to\nIndonesia to implementation of further economic policy reforms.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A government-appointed special\nprosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over\nthe closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank\ngovernor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.\n    Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to\nindicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the\nclosure of <Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.\n    He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed \"within\nthe week\" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that a\ndefendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.\n    Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines'\ncreditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the\ncountry's foreign debt.\n    A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific\nBank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.\n    \"Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the\nappreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a\nmotion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution,\" the\nstatement said.\n    Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after\nFernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is in\nManila, conferred on the telephone.\n    Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after\nhearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, the\npresident of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.\n    In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily\nin ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under\nreceivership without giving the bank the right to appeal,\nthrowing hundreds of employees out of work.\n    Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding\nin Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over Pacific\nBank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January,\n1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.\n    She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by\nappointing two Far East bank executives to central bank\nconsultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She\nalso disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts\nfrom January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a\nprofit, not a loss.\n    The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing\nthat Pacific Bank was \"repeatedly given notice of the continuing\nlosses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up\nadditional capital to eliminate insolvency.\"\n    It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank\nof Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase\nPacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed \"because of certain\nlegal impediments.\"\n    The statement said the central bank invited several banks\nto submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was\napproved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.\n    Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had\ndivested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he\nbecame central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman\ndeclined comment on the charges against Fernandez.\n    In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending\nprosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie\nevidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then\nmembers of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far\nEast executives, and ordered their investigation.\n    He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political\nclimate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.\n    \"(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices\nwas either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and\nhis wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens\n... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any\ninstructions from above,\" Gonzalez wrote.\n    Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office\nhad received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He\nsaid among those facing prosecution were five provincial\ngovernors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Sudan has rejected a demand by the\nInternational Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because\nsuch a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the\nofficial Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.\n    Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his\ngovernment also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies\non basic consumer goods.\n    SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,\nsaid Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum\nyesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.\n    Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is\nsome 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it\nineligible for fresh loans in February last year.\n    In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of\nits pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange\nrate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.\n    Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors\nfor more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations\nhad failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.\nSudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar\nfor foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.\n    Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar\nwas sold at 5.5 pounds today.\n    With stringent import regulations and the government\nincreasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars\nare used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring\ncountries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.\n    Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF\nand Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal\ntalks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's\neconomic performance.\n    The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic\nrecovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious\nattempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade\nits Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.\n    This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of\nhealth from the IMF that it could take to Western government\ncreditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to\nreschedule debt payments.\n    Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to\nmembers of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.\n    Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF\nrepresentative had told him the fund's executive board was \"very\npleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past\ncouple of months.\"\n    The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director\nMichel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan\nowes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.\n    Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs\nbut set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the\nfiscal year ending next June 30.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Emergency action to distribute\nEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved\nso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a\npermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.\n    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores\nbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the\nscheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.\n    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes\nof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has\nbeen distributed to the needy through charities.\n    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to\nhelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter\nand will end on March 31.\n    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether\nto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.\n    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary\nscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units\n(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)\nceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.\n    However, commission sources said the real cost was small if\naccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until\nits quality and value deteriorates.\n    On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC\nfood surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at\nJanuary 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes\nof beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that\noil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the\nAlaska coast which were leased by the federal government to\neight major oil companies.\n    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies\nand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing\nprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that\nchallenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.\n    The administration said that the court-ordered halt in\ndrilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid\nfor 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.\n    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt\nall exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in\nthe Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the\nsubsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.\n    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in\nissuing an injunction halting exploration.\n    \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was\nnot at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.\n\"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact\nthat the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs\nto exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which\nthey would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration\nbeen enjoined,\" he said.\n    The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>,\nMobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil,\nhad said that voiding previously granted leases would result in\nstaggering financial losses.\n    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and\ngenerated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984\ncovered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.\n    Administration officials, saying the lease sales were\npreceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that\nthe oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.\n    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an\norganization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that\nthe drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Subsequent\nrepayments will be determined under a complex structure which\nwill be based on the maturity structure of individual banks'\nloans, the bankers said.\n    The bankers, who declined to be identified, said the\nagreement also will give banks the option to convert their\nexisting debt into term loans for 10-years, with five years\ngrace.\n    An agreement reached last year allowed for the conversion\nof the short-term debt covered by the standstill into\nthree-year loans.\n    Bankers said today's talks concluded months of intense\nnegotiations.\n    They said the South African Finance Ministry is expected to\nmake a statement on the agreement later today.\n    A review of South Africa's economy by the economic\nsubcommittee of commercial banks is nearing completion and\nshould be announced shortly, the bankers said.\n    No further details were immediately available.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "<Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on\nexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in\n1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices\nlast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.\n    But he told a press conference that due to the high\nmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of\nthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330\nmln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.\n    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with\nPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he\nsaid.\n    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and\nproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.\n    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell\nGroup <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,\nup from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against\n8.81 mln.\n    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil\noutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,\nwhich would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the\ncompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the\ncurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline\nin output from the major Brent field, he said.\n    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas\nliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to\nbe maintained in 1987, he said.\n    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey\nNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,\nReid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5\nbillion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil\nprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.\n    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North\nSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the\ncost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.\n    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and\nproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target\nis to keep costs per barrel constant.\n    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to\nthe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to\ngauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.\n    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a\nprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.\n    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell\nU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987\nwere a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"\n    In November and December in particular, refining operations\nhad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil\nproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continue\ngenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip to\nbecome negative from time to time, depending on price\nmovements.\n    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will\nnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five\nmonths behind schedule, following a crane accident which\nseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.\n    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from\n11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical\nsite.\n    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which\ncompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying\ndevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields against\nPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.\n    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in\nthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he\nwould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln\nbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.\n    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain\noutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,\nbut the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will\nfall.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Wall Street's biggest brokerage firms,\neager for funds and foreign ties to fuel international\nexpansion, are expected to find more partnerships among Japan's\ncash-rich companies, analysts said.\n    Yesterday, American Express Co's <AXP> board formally\napproved a linkup with <Nippon Life Insurance Co> for itself\nand its <Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc> brokerage unit. Nippon\nLife will receive 13 pct of Shearson for 538 mln dlrs.\n    Nippon Life's investment in Shearson follows last year's\ninvestment by <Sumitomo Bank Ltd> in <Goldman, Sachs and Co>.\nSumitomo paid 500 mln dlrs for 12.5 pct of the firm.\n    \"There certainly is potential for additional investment or\nfurther linkups with other Japanese financial institutions. I\nthink the pattern has established itself here, and it's\nreasonable to expect further investment down the road,\" said\nPrudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder.\n    Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage\nstocks, resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions.\n    \"The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of\nthe value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to\nbe a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the U.S.,\"\nsaid another analyst.\n    As globalization of the financial markets accelerates,\nJapanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the\nexpertise of the U.S. brokerage industry.\n    Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market\nand Europe has also created a craving for more capital by U.S\nfirms.\n    \"Morgan (Stanley), First Boston, Salomon (Brothers),\nMerrill (Lynch). Those would be the firms more likely to\nconsider hooking up with a Japanese firm, and those would be\nthe ones the Japanese would be most interested in,\" Eckenfelder\nsaid.\n    All of those firms, he said, have been establishing\nthemselves in Japan.\n    While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably,\nthere is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may\nlearn enough from their U.S. partners to ultimately pose the\nsame type of competitive threat they have\nmade in electronics and automobiles.\n    \"The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to\nas markets deregulate. Passive investment is an education\ngathering period. Obviously, there are regulatory barriers\ntoward exercising management control,\" said Samuel Liss, a\nbrokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers.\n    The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approved\nby U.S. regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry. There will\nalso be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson.\n    Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form a\njoint venture company in London to work on investment advisory,\nasset management, and consulting on financing.\n    Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium for\nits stake, but it will also receive warrants for one mln\nAmerican Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson will\nbe cumulative preferred, convertible to common after U.S.\nregulatory approval is granted.\n    American Express has also guaranteed it will retain a\nminimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990.\n    American Express and Nippon are also expected to work\nclosely. For instance, analysts expect it to market the\nAmerican Express card more actively in Japan with the help of\nNippon.\n    \"The key to the deal is not just raising capital for\nShearson, but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon,\" said\nAlan Zimmerman of Kidder, Peabody and Co.\n    American Express stock responded favorably to the\nannouncements, climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today.\n    Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining\na foothold in the U.S. market with the help of American Express\nand Shearson.\n    Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to\nfollow Nippon Life. U.S. insurers have found numerous partners\nthemselves in the brokerage industry.\n    For instance, Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson,\nLufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp, and Prudential Life\nInsurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.\n    Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not be\nlikely acquirors of U.S. firms for the time being, although\nthey have often been rumored suitors in the past. Last year,\nwhen Shearson unsuccessfully courted E.F. Hutton Group <EFH>,\nJapanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

None of the details contained in\ntoday's negotiations was immediately available.\n    The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can\nbe struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export\ncredit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to\nNigeria.\n    The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in\n1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days,\ngovenment sources said there had not been any discussions on\nnew credits.\n    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export\ncredits this year from official agencies under a structrual\nadjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to\nsupport a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr\nforeign debt.\n    But these credits cannot be approved until the export\ncredit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Tonight's American Petroleum Institute\noil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in\ndistillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the\nweek ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.\n    They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted\nby about one to four mln barrels.\n    Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks\nunchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said\nstocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput\nvolumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or\nlower than the week ended March 13, traders said.\n    The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.\ndistillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another \ndraw reflecting historic seasonal trends.\n    For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks\ndown 2.9 mln barrels.\n    Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said\nthey are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the\nspring and summer driving season gets underway this year,\nbecause retail prices are still low compared to recent years.\n    U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels\nfor the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the\noutcome for last week because there is uncertainty about\nwhether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.\n    Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels\nhigher, while others think inventories could be as much as five\nmln barrels below the previous week.\n    The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude\nruns increased and imports fell.\n    The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week\nended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly\nup or down for the week ended March 20.\n    Expectations for product stockdraws are already being\nreflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at\nthe higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect\nwill be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor,\nthey said.\n    Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in\nruns would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of\nElders Energy Futures Inc.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The move by foreign exchange markets to\ntest the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into\nquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one\nof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.\n    Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen\nsharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.\n    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and\ndollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to\nsterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of\nrelatively high U.K. Interest rates.\n    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first\ntentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.\n    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar\ndown further in a test of the willingness of central banks to\nintervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene\neffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.\n    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6\ncollapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.\n    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their\nattention to capital movements whereas previously they had been\nrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.\n    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange\ndealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or\neven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp\ndrop in the U.K. Currency.\n    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.\nPolitical and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and\nrelatively high interest rates, they said.\n    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been\nrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen as\npopular both with the markets and with British voters.\n    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the\nWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is\ntrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.\n    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative\nparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also\nsupported the pound.\n    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two\nhalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than\ntwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the\nnext week or so, has already been largely discounted.\n    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still\nrelatively high compared to other western countries, and\nanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely\nto affect sterling.\n    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,\ndropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.\n    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond\n(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.\n    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has\nbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.\n    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady\nfor the next few days while the market awaits further\ndevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current\naccount figures for February.\n    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg\nafter January's small surplus.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Programs and procedures need to be\nsimplified, streamlined and internally consistent,\" he said.\n    Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middle\nmarket product or service exporter and would have essentially\none loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term\nand long-term export transactions.\n    \"Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, the\nmaximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans will\ncarry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rate\nschedule for the market and the term,\" he said.\n    Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion\ndlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrs\nmay be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10\nbillion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.\n    He said the Bank would have to come back to Congress later\nthis year to discuss its capitalization needs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "American Telephone and Telegraph Co\nsaid it formed a 600-member sales force dedicated exclusively\nto its computers and other data systems products.\n    Separately, ATT denied reports that it plans to buy back a\nlarge chunk of its stock. ATT's stock was up 1/4 points at\n25-1/8 in heavy trading.\n    The company said it also created a separate 600-member team\nthat will educate the computer sales force and its other sales\ngroups on ATT's computer products. This group, ATT said,\nreports directly to Vittorio Cassoni, senior vice president of\nits computer unit, called the Data Systems division.\n    Cassoni, speaking at a news conference at which ATT\nunveiled its most powerful mid-range computer, said the sales\ngroups will provide a \"sharper focus\" to ATT's computer\nmarketing efforts.\n    The executive, hired from Olivetti to bolster ATT's\nunsuccessful campaign to become a major vendor of computer\ngear, also said the company is committed to its 3B line of\nmid-range computers. He said ATT backed the 3B line despite\nwidespread criticism throughout the industry that it is\ninferior to mid-range systems made by International Business\nMachines Corp <IBM>, Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> and others.\n    Cassoni, however, said ATT would strenghten the 3B line\nwithin the next three or four months. He said ATT will offer\nnew, more powerful mid-range computers that will protect the\ninvestments of existing 3B users in ATT hardware and software.\n    In justifying the company's commitment to the 3B line,\nwhich was originally developed for internal use by ATT and its\nformer Bell telephone company units, Cassoni pointed to several\nrecent sales that he said proved the mid-range line's\ncommercial viability.\n    One example he provided was a recent 34 mln dlr deal ATT\nsigned with the United States Postal Service.\n    Cassoni also said ATT will announce a new personal computer\nbased on the powerful 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp\n<INTC>.\n   Compaq Computer Corp <CPQ> is already selling a 386-based PC\nand IBM is widely expected to announce a 386 machine sometime\nthis year.\n   Cassoni said the Data Systems division is unprofitable and\nthat it will take \"a couple of years\" for the division to meet\nits goal of making a \"substantial contribution to ATT's\nearnings stream.\" But, he added, the division is \"approaching\"\nthe point where it can start making money.\n    Cassoni said the new products introduced today are \"a very\nsignificant step to foster our efforts in the computer\nbusiness.\"\n    Among the new offerings is the 3B2/600 minicomputer, which\nATT said can provide up to four times the processing power of\nthe 3B2/400, previously its biggest computer.\n    But with a top speed of 4.0 mips, or million instructions\nper second, the top-of-line 3B cannot match the computing power\nof rival systems from IBM and DEC.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "South Africa will repay 13 pct of its\nfrozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the\nnext three years under an agreement reached today in London,\nFinance Minister Barend du Plessis said.\n    He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the\ndebt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.\n   \"These arrangements confirm South Africa's continued\nwillingness to maintain good relations with its foreign\ncreditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,\"\ndu Plessis told a news conference.\n    Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was\n\"substantially a continuation\" of the arrangement ending in June\nand calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on\nits total foreign debt of 23 billion dlrs.\n    The new debt standstill will extend from July 1, 1987, to\nJune 30, 1990, with a three pct down payment permitted on July\n15, 1987, \"provided such debt has already reached maturity,\" du\nPlessis said.\n    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis told a new conference\nthat 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt\nagreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African\nnegotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are\nexpected to approve the agreement, he said.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement\nwas a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks and added\nthat the three-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous\nsignificance\" to South Africa.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement\nwas a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks.\n    Besides the 13-billion-dlr frozen debt, South Africa also\nowes ten billion dlrs of debt that includes a significant\namount of medium -term liabilities that will continue to be\nrepaid on normal maturity dates.\n    The 13 pct to be repaid under the standstill amounts to\n1.42 billion dollars.\n    A total of five pct or 508 mln dlrs will be repaid in the\nsecond half of 1987, with 3.5 pct or 400 mln dlrs in calendar\n1988, three pct or 346 mln dlrs in calendar 1989 and 1.5 pct or\n166 mln dlrs in the first half of 1990.\n    Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the\nfrozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South\nAfrican negotiators in London.\n    About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve\nthe agreement, he said.\n    De Kock, speaking at the same news conference, said the\nthree-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\"\nto South Africa.\n    De Kock said South Africa had negotiated from a \"position of\nbasic economic financial strength.\"\n    \"We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now\nunderborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever\nheard of,\" he said.\n    Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve\nBank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two\nmonths, and a continued current account surplus \"will be\nsufficient\" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.\n    Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence\nin the South African economy and country as a whole.\n    He attributed this to \"restoration of law and order which\nhas greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the\nintensity of unrest.\"\n    South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June\n1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over\n2,400 lives in the past three years.\n    Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks\nand South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good\nrelations with its foreign creditors.\n    He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign\ninvestors were again \"taking a more realistic view\" of South\nAfrica.\n    Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the\nsharp increase in foreign exchange reserves.\n    Of the 13 billion dlr frozen debt, 3.5 billion dlrs was\nowed by the public sector and 9.5 billion dlrs by private\nindustry, du Plessis said.\n    The remaining 10 billion dlrs consisted of seven billion\ndlrs owed by government agencies and three billion dlrs by the\nprivate sector.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, faced\nwith a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and\nan ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its\nbad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.\n    Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that\nbad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,\nstood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.\n    Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in\nthe specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax\nbreaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while\n71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.\n    In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for\n1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total\npre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.\n    \"The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore\nand Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping\nindustry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and\ndoubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on\ntop of the normal level of provisioning,\" Barber said.\n    He said, \"the decision was also taken to build up loan loss\nreeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for\ngeneral provisions for commercial and cross border risks.\"\n    Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific\nregion made \"a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.\"\n    He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses\nwas \"well maintained, although the reported result was affected\nby cross border debt provisioning,\" while Californian subsidiary\nUnion Bank \"showed continued growth.\"\n    \"Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in\nexcellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,\" he\nsaid.\n    Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a\ntakeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthened\nits capital resources during that year to just over three\nbillion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.\n    Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary\ncapital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Fairchild is\nnow a Maryland corporation.\n    Fairchild also cited Delaware's recently enacted statutory\nprovisions relating to directors' liability, allowing companies\nto place limits on liability and expand their ablility to\nprotect corporate officers.\n    William E. Fulwider, company spokesman, said Fairchild has\nno specific plans to alter its capital structure.\n    Fairchild said that if stockholders approve the\nreincorporation, it would merge into a Delaware corporation and\nits common and preferred would be automatically converted to \nthe new corporation's shares, without any exchange of stock,\nalong with other assets and liabilities.\n    Fairchild also said the new corporation would retain its\nfair price charter provision.\n    Earlier this month, Fairchild announced that it reached an\nagreement with the Air Force to stop production on the T-46A\ntrainer jet.\n    As a result, Fairchild said, it will close its Farmingdale,\nN.Y., plant this year and layoff most of the plant's 2,800\nemployees, about a quarter of its entire workforce.\n    Fairchild reported a 73.6 mln dlr fourth quarter loss\nmainly due to charges for the plant closing and ending of the\ntrainer jet program. For the year, it reported a 10 mln dlr\nloss, compared with a loss of 167.1 mln dlrs in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Dixons\nsaid earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.\n    The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be\nsatisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons\nwere rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have\npaid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the\nconsummation of Cyacq's offer.\n    Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on\nApril three, 1987, unless extended.\n    Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business\nCredit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln\ndlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln\ndlrs from 250 mln dlrs.\n    Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have\nincreased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the\nnew total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.\n    Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy\nall Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees\nand expenses.\n    It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5\nmln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.\n    All previously announced conditions regarding the lending\ngroup led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except\nthat the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq\nof equity contributions and other financing of not less than\n210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs\nfor the merger facility.\n    Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no\nindications of interest in an alternative offer it had made\nfrom Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp <Y>, which has agreed to\nacquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.\n    Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with\nCyacq's approval, proposed to acquire the industrial group from\nDixons.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Eastman Kodak Co said it will\nreduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber\noperations of its Eastman Chemicals division.\n    A company spokesman said the company will take \"some\nwriteoff\" in connection with the action in the first quarter\nand there will probably be a further \"carryover\" writeoff in\nthe second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of\nplants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected\nwith the staff cuts.\n    Kodak said the division will discontinue production of\npolyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its\nCarolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100\nmln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,\nmostly in Columbia.\n    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in\nColumbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,\nand about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in\nKingsport, Tenn.\n    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved\nthrough an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan\nfor employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products\nInc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense\nCorp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be\ncompleted by April 30.\n    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance\nhave led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY\nproduction will be shut down as a result of its exit from the\nbusiness. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman\nsince last year.\n    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel\npolyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from\n500 mln due to lesser demand.\n    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase\nin a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.\n    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport\nunits affected about 10,800.\n    The company spokesman later said the charges will be\ninsignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The shareholders of Illinois\nCooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many\nMidwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote\nWednesday on its possible dissolution.\n    The directors of the company called a special meeting and\nrecommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume\nand increasing costs.\n    Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout\nof Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital\nstock, led to the call for dissolution.\n    The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing\nhouses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional\nand local cooperatives that comprise its membership.\n    Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm\ncooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded\nIllinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.\n    But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer\nDaniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through\na joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.\n    With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade\nfutures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president\nof the co-op.\n    Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a\ncooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A\nnotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became\naffiliated with Cargill, Inc.\n    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional\ncooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,\nof Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries\nin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and\nHarvest States in Minneapolis.\n    Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative\nFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.\n    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives\nare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one\ncash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm\ncooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few\nmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.\n    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the\nNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives\nexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.\n    \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has\nbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of\nconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"\n    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the\nmajor commercials for export, rather than exporting it\nthemselves, losing potential profits.\n    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the\nmulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers\nExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make\nfolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.\n    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is\napproved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather\nthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.\n    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\n\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of\nmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\ndoing business.\"\n    \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\n\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\nThere are plenty of capable firms.\"\n    Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing\nwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures\nthrough a Chicago-based cooperative.\n    \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to\nindividuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but\nadded, \"The times change and with changing times, come\ndifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"\n    Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had\nnothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you\nthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy\norganization.\"\n    In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois\nCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'\nequity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for\nthe most recent year has not been filed.\n    Under the cooperative system, income from operations is\nreturned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.\n    Income and refunds in the past five years have been\ndeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\nreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\nmln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,\n1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.\n    \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan\nsaid. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"\n    According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark\nowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common\nshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.\n    Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital\nGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the\nfigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.\nEquity is distributed according to each member's trading volume\nand, as a result, changes from year to year.\n    However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet\nminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark\npulled out.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Heavy buying by speculators boosted\nConrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash\ntender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>.\n    \"It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria,\" said one arbitrageur,\nreferring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per\nshare and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knight\nwilling to bid 36.50 dlrs.\n    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed\nlike an \"appropriate price.\" Another said \"it's too early to\nproject the outcome.\"\n    \"The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr\noffer is inadequate,\" the second arbitrageur said. But he added\nit was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more\nthan the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.\n    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and\nthere could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is\nable to thwart Mark IV.\n    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board\nstudies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it\nwould make a recommendation by April 17.\n    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in\nseveral takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a\ndetermined bidder. \"They're not beginners,\" he said.\n    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find\nanother buyer. \"It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,\"\nhe said. \"There is only a small universe of people who would\nwant to own the company as it's presently structured.\"\n    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,\naircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding\nequipment and other products.\n    \"I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for\nthose who can take the risk,\" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at\nMilwaukee Co.\n    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV \"fair value but on\nthe low side.\" \"I don't think management was looking for a\nbuyer in any way before this offer,\" he said.\n    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has\ndeveloped a reputation for quality products that serve niche\nmarkets. He said management has done a good job of turning\naround the telephone answering machine business.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It said its outstanding 10-3/4 pct\nsubordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay the\nexercise price of the warrants.\n    Wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  E.F.\nHutton and Co Inc, Kidder Peabody and Co Inc, and Smith Barney\nharris Upham Inc.\n    Simultaneous with the offering, Wainoco said it intends to\nredeem its shareholder value rights attached to each common\nshare at 10 cts per right. Wainoco said without redemption of\nthe value rights, the company would not have sufficient\nauthorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the\nunits offering.\n    Due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pct\nsubordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is\ncontingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.\n    Wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributed\nto the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remain\nvalid.\n    It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadian\nsubsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset\nall of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its\ndebenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.\n    Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions has\nbeen increased by an amount which should generate savings that\nwill exceed existing deferred income tax liability.\n    Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S.\nare not materially affected, the company said. It added this\nwill considerably reduce future income taxes in Canada and add\nto Wainoco's net income and cash flow for a number of years.\n    John Ashmun, chairman of Wainoco, said \"as a result of this\nrecapitalization, Wainoco will be in a strong financial\nposition.\n    \"Our net income and cash flow will benefit from lower\ninterest expense, lower Canadian taxes, and the considerable\nsavings achieved over the past few years from cost reductions,\"\nhe said.\n    Ashmun said the company will be able to \"utilize enhanced\ncash flow to develop its large resource base and explore for\nadditional reserves at a time when exploration and development\ncosts are low and opportunities abound rather than using a\ndisproportiaonate share of cash flow for debt service.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Cocoa Organization\n(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with\nmany delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.\n    \"Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in\nplace by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation\nMonday,\" a consumer delegate said. \"The atmosphere is excellent.\"\n    Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be\noperational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,\nif the rules are agreed by Friday.\n    A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy\nand sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group\nthis afternoon -- a big step toward a \"very interesting stage of\nnegotiations,\" delegates said.\n    The package, based on negotiating principles informally\nagreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during\nfortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena\nErbynn and a small group of other delegates.\n    Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are\nscheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly\ntomorrow.\n    Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy\ncocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer\nsystem. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when\nhe wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage\ndesired, delegates said.\n    The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather\nthan choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference\nto ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials\nwould be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to\ndetermine the relative competitiveness of offers of various\ncocoas from different origins, they said.\n    The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a\nmember country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,\nthe delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority\nvote of the ICCO council.\n    Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would\nnot be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they\nsaid.\n    The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per\nday and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,\nintermediate and forward positions, they added.\n    One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is\n\"transparency,\" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's\nmarket activities will be public and he will have as little\ndiscretion as possible, delegates said.\n    After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the\nInternational Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa\ndelegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market\nmechanism, they said.\n     Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to\nbegin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the\napproaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to\nadjourn, delegates said.\n    The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when\nthe new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The\nexisting buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in\nplace with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable\nuntil rules are agreed.\n     Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the\nlast chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,\nproducers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing\nmechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,\ndelegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "There is a good chance that the United\nStates and Latin America will agree reforms in the\nInter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks\nyesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Mexican\nFinance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.\n    \"This is a complex issue, but I am very optimistic on an\nagreement, he told reporters during the IADB's annual meeting\nhere.\n    The U.S., which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank, has\nproposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct, a move strongly\nopposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct.\n    Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the\nissue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and\nWorld Bank interim meetings next month in Washington.\n    He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America's\nposition during talks yesterday with the so-called \"A\"\ncountries - Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer\na net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a\nsubstantial capital increase.\n    Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of\nfunds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90, plus\n2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment.\n    But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a\nnine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms\nwere agreed, a position described today by Nicaragua's Central\nBank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic.\n    Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed \"flexibility in\nbeing prepared to accommodate different proposals\" and promised\nto look into alternatives.\n    He said an alternative now being looked at was for new\nprocedures for delaying IADB loan approval, to satisfy U.S.\nconcern that lending is currently too lax, rather than a change\nin the basic voting structure.\n    There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it\nwould need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a\nyear, after which a second review would require a 40 pct\nblocking vote.\n    \"Any change in the basic voting structure would require a\nchange in the IADB's charter, and in turn a lengthy process of\nprior approval by the Congresses of each country,\" Petricioli\nsaid. In common with Venezuela, he expressed reservations on\nthe conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington's\nproposals for increased IADB sectoral lending, but welcomed a\nbigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The state oil company Petroeleos de\nVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from\noil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by\nalmost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines\nArturo Hernandez Grisanti said.\n    Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual\nassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had\ndropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last\nyear's 13.3 billion.\n    Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66\nbillion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34\npct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on\nVenezuela.\"\n    PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of\nwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined\nproducts.\n    The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd\nand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not\nenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price\nfrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.\n    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher\nthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.\nHernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting\nsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining\nand marketing operations.\n    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from\n323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,\nHernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep\ngasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.\n    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels\nin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of\nVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's\nproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of\nwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.\n     Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986\nwere 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the\nworld, Hernandez said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln\ndlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its\npetroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in\nthe United States.\n    The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes\nsaid. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as\nlong as economic growth continues, but future large grain\nsurpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure\non prices.\n    Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,\ncompared to three mln dlrs in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings\ncan be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are\ncompleted, it said.\n    The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings\nshould be positive, it added, as it will allow capital\nexpenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and\ndivisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the\nEuropean business.\n    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced\nin November, CPC said.\n    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred\nin the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty\nbaking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was \npart of the restructuring.\n    As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its\ncommon shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a\ntotal cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual\nreport.\n    In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a\ntotal of about 170 mln dlrs.\n    CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn\nwet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,\nincluding that incurred under the share buyback.\n    In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common\nstock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it\nauthorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.\n    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in\nNovember, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,\nchairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of\nCPC's then outstanding stock.\n    In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales\nof 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8\nmln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln\ndlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.\n    The businesses' assets were 645.7 mln dlrs in 1986, the\nreport said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A new agreement covering the repayment\nof part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromise\nbetween that country and its commercial bank creditors\nfollowing several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations,\nsenior banking sources said.\n    In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed\nthe agreement a \"good deal\" for both South Africa and the banks.\n    But as one senior banker noted, \"It is probably the best we\ncould hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the\nSouth Africans) didn't want to pay.\"\n    The new agreement will extend for three years the\nstandstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985\nand which was due to expire on June 30.\n    Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will\nreceive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the\narrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.\n    It also will require the repayment over the life of the\nstandstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over\nsix month invervals and depending on the maturity of the\nvarious debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion\ndlrs.\n    Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the\n14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers\nhad argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the\ncountry's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even\nlarger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had\nbeen speculation that the standstill would be extended for\nthree years, many did not believe that a long term pact would\nbe acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line\nin the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid\npolicies.\n    The agreement reached today differs very little from the\none reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include\none moderation of an option contained in that pact which\nintroduces yet another \"catchphrase\" into the jargon for\nreschedulings.\n    The new agreement contains an \"exit vehicle\" under which\nbanks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the\nprevious agreement banks were only given options for three year\nloans.\n    While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it\ncould offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than\nhalf their investment over the next seven years.\n    To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower\nlooking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate\nindividually the interest rates to be charged.\n    The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan\nwould be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a\nrepayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of\nface value by year seven, one banker said.\n    Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and\neconomic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the\noption it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers.\nThey noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is\nan active borrower in this area of the market.\n    Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief\ndebt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill\nCoordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on\nthe commercial bank technical committee.\n    The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the\ncountry's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation\ncovering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.\n    Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's\napartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with\nFritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank,\nacting as mediator.\n    Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not\ninvolved himself in the negotiations since last year, the\nbankers said.\n    Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal\nto Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time\nthe procedure will be less structured and will be up to the\nindividual banks as to how they wish to handle it.\n    Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the\nSouth Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement\non the repayments took many in the financial community by\nsurprise.\n    A review of South Africa's economy by the technical\ncommittee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February\nwhile the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some\ntime this month or next month.\n    However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity\nwhich surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings\nwere kept secret.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic\nPolicy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost\nthe U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.\n    \"This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the\ntrade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the\nWashington Democrat said.\n    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift\ncontrols on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over\nthe next three years unless other countries agree to comparable\ncontrols.\n    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of\ntechnology such as medical instruments.\n    It would also give the Commerce Department primary\nauthority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit\nthe Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing\nrequests to export highly-sensitive technology.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "South Africa will repay 13 pct of its\nfrozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the\nnext three years under an agreement reached today in London,\nFinance Minister Barend du Plessis said.\n    He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the\ndebt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.\n    \"These arrangements confirm South Africa's continued\nwillingness to maintain good relations with its foreign\ncreditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,\"\ndu Plessis told a news conference.\n    Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was\n\"substantially a continuation\" of the arrangement ending in June\nand calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on\nits total foreign debt of over 23 billion dlrs.\n    Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the\nfrozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South\nAfrican negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks\nalso are expected to approve the agreement, he said.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement\nwas a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks.\n    Speaking at the same news conference, de Kock said the\nthree-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\"\nto South Africa.\n    He said South Africa had negotiated from a \"position of\nbasic economic financial strength.\"\n    \"We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now\nunderborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever\nheard of,\" de Kock said.\n    Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve\nBank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two\nmonths, and a continued current account surplus \"will be\nsufficient\" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.    \nDu Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in\nthe South African economy and country as a whole.\n    He attributed this to \"restoration of law and order which\nhas greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the\nintensity of unrest.\"\n    South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June\n1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over\n2,400 lives in the past three years.\n    Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks\nand South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good\nrelations with its foreign creditors.\n    He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign\ninvestors were again \"taking a more realistic view\" of South\nAfrica. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and\nthe sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.\n    Of the 13 billion dlrs frozen debt 3.5 billion was owed by\npublic sector and 9.5 billion by private industry, du Plessis\nsaid. The remaining 10 billion consists of seven billion owed\nby government agencies and three billion by the private sector.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
