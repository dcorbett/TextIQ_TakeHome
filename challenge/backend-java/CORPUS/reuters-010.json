Recently many of the products of genetic\nengineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.\n    Merck and Co Inc <MRK> already sells a genetically\nengineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called Recombivax\nHB. A subsidiary of <SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKline\nBiologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis B\nvaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.\n    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also been\nformally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has been\nauthorized for market in a number of Far East countries.\n    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in many\nparts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15\npct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about\n200,000 new cases occur each year.\n    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen's\npatent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appeal\nonce it receives a formal written opinion from the office.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Private investors eagerly snapped up\nshares of Consolidated Rail Corp, the biggest initial stock\noffering in U.S. history, but some analysts warned they could\nbe in a for a bumpy ride at least in the near term.\n    Analyst James Voytko of PaineWebber Group Inc believes some\ninvestors who bought at the offering price of 28 dlrs will be\ntempted to sell. The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.\nVoytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the\n35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously\nbankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.\n    \"Conrail is in the best position to weather the current\ntremendous price competition in the transportation industry in\ngeneral,\" said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,\na research firm.\n    \"It will survive and do damn well,\" said another analyst\nwho declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight\ntrains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major\nU.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.\n    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on\ncoal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail\nto earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.\n    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down\nthe road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be\ndistributed to current and former employees. He believes many\nof these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.\n    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the\naverage employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would\nwould not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would\ncreate a big downward push on the price.\n    \"It's hard to call,\" said the analyst who requested\nanonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate\nindividuals to keep their shares, he said.\n    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,\nbelieves the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is\nable to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00\ndlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by\n1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed\nfor rail operations is invested wisely.\n    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins\nsaid, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at\nconservative rates.\n    He believes motor freight will be one area of\ndiversification Conrail will explore.\n    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose\ndepartment was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that\nConrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot\ndefer necessary maintenance.\n    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited\nthe New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor\nwearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to\nStanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.\n    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88\nbillion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees\nand other adjustments.\n    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next\nfive years is another issue troubling some investors.\n    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb\nfrom 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5\nmln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession\nyear, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.\n    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will\nbe 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and\nexactly the same as in 1981.\n    \"Their basic business isn't going anywhere,\" he says,\nexplaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.\n    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession\nyear. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a\nrecession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990\nrecession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20\ndlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and\n3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering\nof the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.\n    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26\ndlr level.\n    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. A\ntotal of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It was not immediately clear\nwhether contract talks were continuing at the facility.\n    General Motors spokesman Frank Cronin said the three plants\nat Pontiac stopped working \"as of noon today.\"\n    He said talks will resume Friday at 1000 EST in Pontiac.\n\"We're hoping (the strike) will be of very brief duration,\"\nCronin said.\n    Bus-manufacturing operations at one of the three\nplants--the Pontiac Central facility--are being sold to\nGreyhound Corp <G>, although GM will retain the facility.\n    Cronin said about 400 workers on the bus line will be laid\noff \"whenever we fulfill production commitments\" on the buses,\n\"possibly in May.\"\n    The Pontiac Central plant also makes medium- and heavy-duty\ntrucks. Assembly of the medium trucks is scheduled to move to\nJanesville, Wis., in 1990, Chronin said.\n    Heavy truck operations at the plant will be taken over by\nGM's joint venture with Volvo AB, and all vehicle assembly\noperations at the facility will eventually be ended, Chronin\nsaid. The plant also has sheet metal operations, which are so\nfar unaffected, he said.\n    The other two plants at Pontiac--Pontiac East and Pontiac\nWest--make full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Polish government has backed down\nfrom some proposed price rises in the face of strong opposition\nfrom trade unions, but has restated its commitment to economic\nreforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures.\n    Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unions\nthat sharp price hikes could spark confrontation, the\ngovernment has agreed that food prices this year will rise an\naverage 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct.\n    A statement last night said the government had \"partially\naccepted\" demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreed\nto extend some social benefits.\n    But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, at a separate\nmeeting yesterday, sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms.\n    He told an economic commission that tougher discipline and\nausterity measures, greater efficiency and initiative should\nreplace waste, red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cutting\nmeasures affecting central administrative bodies.\n    OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move on\nfood prices. \"This decrease was considerable,\" Kochan told\nReuters today. \"Also important is the fact that the government\nadmitted we were right and agreed to consult us over prices\nfrom now on,\" he added.\n    The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases,\nor price rises in sectors including transport and energy.\n    The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as\n26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort to\nmake the market more free and to improve efficiency.\n    The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the government\nand replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martial\nlaw. They claim a membership of seven million.\n    Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food prices\nwas a limited concession. \"This is a small price to pay if they\ncan push through the other price rises,\" one said, adding that\nfuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect.\n    He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign to\nprepare people for price rises, including a major article in a\nmass-circulation women's magazine, \"clearly aimed at those who\ndo the shopping,\" he said.\n    Other articles in the official press this week have focused\non coal, which sells to both industrial and private consumers\nat far less than either the production or export costs.\n    Countering scepticism from opposition sources and former\nSolidarity activists as to OPZZ's role, Kochan said \"It was\ndefinitely not a question of gaining credibility, but true\nconcern for people's living standards.\"\n    Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities'\nmain aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he was\nalso quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying the\ngovernment had to take current economic realities into account.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Federal Reserve Board Governor\nRobert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by\npermitting formation of financial services holding companies\ninvolved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and\nsecurities.\n    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank\nand Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, \"I believe\nthat increased diversification along geographic and product\nlines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.\"\n    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding\ncompanies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding\nCompanies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,\ninsurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries\nwould be handled on functional lines.\n    \"Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the\nbank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would\nhave to be on an arms-length basis,\" Heller said.\n    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'\nspecial position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.\n    Heller said he \"would require the holding company to serve\nas a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to\nmaintain the bank's capital.\n    \"In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as\nlong as the holding company has a positive net worth.\"\n    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted\nto own a financial services holding company, again with the\nprovision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise\nif necessary.\n    Heller said the effects of these actions \"would be banks\nthat are at least as strong as the corporations holding them\" in\nwhich customer deposits were assured while any incentive to\n\"loot the bank\" was removed.\n    Such diversification would give access to national and\ninternational financial services to corporations across the\nUnited States.\n    Heller said that would mean \"the steady decline of America's\nbanks in the world financial league tables would be arrested\" by\npermitting them to become more competitive.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting to\nbenefit from the market impact of a client's order by trading\non his own account before placing the client's order.\n    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to have\nimplemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of all\ntrades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part to\ndiscourage abuse of dual trading.\n    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nhas proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in the\nStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.\n    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiring\nimproved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns about\ndual trading abuses.\n    \"It would be inappropriate at this point until we see how\nthe audit trail will work,\" she said in response to a question.\n    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments by\nmarkets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successful\nand that users of securities and derivative instruments were\nstill learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.\n    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of\nstock index futures, options on those futures and options on\ncertain individual stocks.\n    The CFTC chairman noted the commission has heightened\nsurveillance of markets on triple-witching day.\n    \"We aren't sure any other regulatory changes are needed at\nthis point,\" Phillips said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive\njury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance\nliability problem.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Much of\nthe money was paid to him for lobbying for controversial South\nKorean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.\n    The 77-year-old Anderson was President Eisenhower's\ntreasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 and a prominent\nbusinessman afterwards. In his memoirs, Eisenhower said\nAnderson deserved to be president.\n    Standing before Federal Court Judge Edmund Palmieri,\nAnderson, who faces up to 10 years in jail, said he had\nrecently undergone two operations and treatment for alcoholism.\n    The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney\nRudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that\nAnderson be sent to jail.\n    According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of\nthe Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the\nBritish West Indies for two years ending in 1985.\n    During that time, government prosecutors said the bank\nconducted operations in New York city but failed to register\nwith state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have\nlost at least 4 mln dlrs.\n    Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but\nadmitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and\nfaces civil fines for both years.\n    Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983\nfrom a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification\nChurch. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan\nrepayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been\nreported as income.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearing\nof the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit\nand Rural Development.\n      U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposed\nregulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge over\ndomestic futures sellers because they would be subject to less\nrigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.\n      Phillips said the commission has no way of requiring\nforeign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards as\nin the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketing\nof foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.\n     \"If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets,\nthey know they will not have the same regulations,\" she said.\n      Phillips said the commission would consider changes in\nits proposal to require segregation of customer accounts and\nclarify the treatment of contracts not traded on foreign\nexchanges.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "British Petroleum Co Plc does not\nintend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer\nfor the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing\nDirector David Simon said.\n    \"We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game,\" he\ntold reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of\nStandard's stock.\n    Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its\nplanned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not\nidentify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company\nis not going to raise its offer.\n    \"I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think\nthe price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate\nabout ligigation,\" he said. \"Let's wait and see how the offer\nruns.\"\n    Another official declined to speculate under what\ncircumstances BP might raise its bid.\n    The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times\nStandard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent\nevaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its\noil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.\n    He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid\nfor publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times\ncash flow.\n    The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct\npremium over Standard's stock price over the past year.\n    BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as\nmuch as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its\noffer will come from existing sources. The rest will be\nfinanced by new debt.\n    BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around\nthe world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of\ncredit, he explained.\n    The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12\npercentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is\ncompleted, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct\nwithin 12 months, he added.\n    Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly\nheld shares are held by financial institutions.\n    Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on\nMarch nine and has been considering it since that time.\n    He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that\nwould delay completion of the acquisition. \"We have informed\nWashington of our intentions and we've already been an integral\npart of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,\" he pointed out.\n    Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that\nthe more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in\nSaudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.\n    \"We think there are signals that current conditions are\nmore favorable than they have been for sometime,\" Simon said.\n    \"We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see\nprices going much higher,\" he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay\n7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has\nsignalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.\n    \"I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and\nclear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they\nthink the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,\"\nsaid Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\n    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70\ndlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already\nown.\n    \"It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the\nwar and oil prices are not going to crack,\" said Prescott, Ball\nand Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.\n    \"Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the\nenergy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those\nthat are acquisition targets,\" Lazier said.\n    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an\nenergy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl\nIcahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a\nCourt last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.\n    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms\nfalling into takeover situations for several years, with the\nexception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of\nthe majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking\nwhich ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point\nthat they have become unattractive.\n    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon\nCorp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped\n1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal\nCorp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>\nclimbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.\n    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to\n71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.\nWall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its\noffer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it\nwould not raise the 70 dlr bid.\n    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.\n    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in\nthe first place indicates that the British oil giant has\nchanged its outlook for the oil industry.\n    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the\nmore bearish positions on oil prices.\n    \"They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a\nbarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty\nretreat from that point of view,\" Margoshes said.\n    \"They are more appropriately today looking more\noptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs\n(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that\nwill be exceeded,\" Margoshes said.\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was\ntrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.\n    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy\nup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when\noil prices were falling last year.\n    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly\nmore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil\nfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests in\nthe Alaskan North Slope.\n    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely\nattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and\nhas hard-to-replace reserves.\n    \"I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to\nincrease their position in the U.S. market,\" Dean Witter\nanalyst Eugene Nowak said.\n    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the\nBritish government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP\nstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding\nsometime in the year beginning April one.\n    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves\nwould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is\nheld in the U.S.\n    \"The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it\ninto the United States. No other market can handle all that\nstock,\" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.\n    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on\nrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year\nearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.\n    \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates\nlower, he said \"the two half point cuts (this month in banks'\nbase lending rates) have been appropriate up until now.\"\n    Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a \"cautious step-by-step\napproach\" to reducing short term interest rates, not least\nbecause \"we have a potential problem with inflation.\"\n    Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, \"one\nof the highest\" among industrialised nations, he added.\n    Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted\nbase rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget\non March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for\nsuch a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10\npct.\n    Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton\nsaid that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.\n    He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel\nmight suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling\nindex, when compared with the index's level before oil prices\ndropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975,\nclosed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They said\nits impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated as\nprimary dealers in U.S. government securities since other\ncountries would meet the equal access rule.\n    \"Even Japan, at which the proposal seems to be particularly\naimed, has made a number of advances in opening its market to\nU.S. firms,\" Volcker said.\n    The legislation gives the administration six months to\nnegotiate equal access for U.S. firms in the foreign government\nsecurities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in the\nU.S. would take effect.\n    Volcker said more progress could be made by continuing\nnegotiations without adopting the bill's more rigid approach.\n    An aide to Rep. Charles Schumer, the New York Democratic\nsponsor, said it is expected to pass in the House trade bill.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Bank of Montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans to\nBrazil as of last September 30, the most of any Canadian bank.\n     Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68\nbillion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.\n     Asked if Bank of Montreal were considering declaring its\nBrazil loans non-performing, Reuber replied: \"We haven't really\ngot to that point because we don't think we will have to face\nthat issue.\"\n    Some bankers in the U.S. said earlier this week that slow\nprogress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign lenders\nhas increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare their\nBrazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.\n     Reuber told reporters the bank was still pondering its\nstrategy regarding possible entry into the securities business\nafter June 30 when banks and other financial institutions will\nbe allowed full participation in the Ontario securities\nindustry.\n    He said price would help determine if the bank formed its\nown securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer,\nadding that asking prices for some dealers seem \"fairly high.\"\n    Asked about plans for wholly owned Harris Bankcorp Inc, of\nChicago, Reuber said Harris might consider acquiring more small\ncommunity banks around Chicago.\n    \"In addition, I think we are giving some consideration to\nthe possibility of extension into other states,\" Reuber said of\nHarris, although he added that any such move was unlikely this\nyear.\n    In his speech, focusing on current free trade talks between\nthe U.S. and Canada, Reuber said failure to reach a deal would\nnot represent a calamity for Canada but could lower Canada's\nstandard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country's\nworld trading influence.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said USX was not conducting talks with any other\npossible buyer of its energy assets.\n    Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per\nshare for the Standard Oil Co's <SRD> publicly held stock.\n    USX said in December the company had held formal\ndiscussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its\noverseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of\ninterest from a half dozen other oil companies.\n    Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no\nimmediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas\nOil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of\nits 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.\n    \"We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field\nduring these difficult times,\" Roderick added.\n    In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not\nknow whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was\naccumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested\nHolmes a Court was buying additional shares.\n    Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion\ndlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold\na sizable interest in the company. \"Mr. Ichan still apparently\nhas 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,\"\nRoderick said. \"He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I\ntalk with him monthly.\"\n    In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of\nthe dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade\ndeficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.\n    \"I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net\ntrade surplus,\" Roderick said. \"I think the worst is over and\nwe can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.\"\n    However, the USX chairman warned that European trading\npartners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. \"Some\neconomic discomfort must be transferred from the United States\nto our friends, trading partners and allies.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Debt securities of major U.S. banks\ncame under light selling pressure in secondary trading on the\nheels of Standard and Poor's Corp's downgrade of six money\ncenter banks late yesterday, analysts and traders said.\n    But they described market response as muted because the S\nand P action came as no surprise. Besides, many participants\nhad already shied away from bank issues following Brazil's\nsuspension of interest payments last month, traders added.\n    \"The downgrades were expected for some time. In fact, you\ncan argue that S and P is lagging the market,\" commented one\ntrader.\n    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest\npayments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial\nbanks. No date was established for the renewal of payments.\n    In its action, Standard and Poor's cited the exposure to\nmajor Latin American debtor countries of Chase Manhattan Corp\n<CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Irving Bank Corp <V> and\nManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>.\n    The rating agency also downgraded Mellon Financial Corp\n<MEL> and Security Pacific  Corp <SPC>, but said this reflected\nhigher non-performing assets and weaker operating results\nrather than the international debt problem.\n    \"The S and P downgrades were a non-event,\" a trader said.\n\"Anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situation\nanyway.\"\n    Said another trader, \"People talked about this before and\nafter S and P's announcement. There was not much reaction among\nbank issues today, though prices are still below par.\"\n    Still, market watchers said the action further undermined\nsentiment for bank paper.\n    Because of Brazil's suspension of interest payments, U.S.\nbank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities,\ntelephones and industrials, analysts pointed out.\n    Even though Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt ratings\nof Citicorp <CCI>, Bankers Trust New York <BT>, Bank of Boston\nCorp <BKB> and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>, few buyers can be\nfound for securities issued by those banks, traders said.\n    \"Let's face it. Investors believe these banks are also\nexposed to Latin and other debtor countries. And investors buy\non perceptions,\" said one broker.\n    About the only bright spots in an otherwise dull banking\nsector of the secondary corporate market are U.S. regional\nbanks and Japanese banks because investors perceive them as\nless exposed to the debtor nations, analysts pointed out.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\nprovinces have traditionally had authority in the securities\nfield while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.\n    But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that \nOttawa should retain its regulatory powers to \"preserve an\nefficient, competitive, national financial system.\"\n    On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylor\nsaid Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much access\nto the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.\n    He told a new conference later he was \"reasonably\nconfident\" the Canadian side was making reciprocity in\nfinancial services an issue at the negotiating table.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Many London equity dealers doubt whether\nthe much publicised flood of Japanese investment into the U.K.\nEquity market will be as large as some analysts have forecast.\n    There has recently been much speculation that the Japanese\nwould look towards the U.K. Stock market for investment\nopportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal year\nbegins next month. Last October's reorganisation of the stock\nmarket, known as 'Big Bang', paved the way for greater\nparticipation by overseas investors.\n    Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massive\nsums for investment in Europe.\n    Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead strongly\nsince the start of this year. But London has lagged behind in\nreal terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving a\nbetter return on any funds that are reserved for equity\ninvestment. Sterling's firmness also means there are profits to\nbe made from the currency turn. However, many equity dealers\npolled by Reuters think that the Japanese will shy away from\nLondon and continue to invest in instruments such as U.S.\nGovernment securities.\n    Even if they do diversify from their old stamping grounds\nthey will head for the U.S. Equity market before they come to\nthe European stock markets, one dealer predicted.\n    \"The Japanese, although very aggressive in markets that they\nknow, tend to be more conservative in those they don't...Even\nif they do come to London in a big way they would tend to go\nmore for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than the\nmore volatile equities,\" he added.\n    He also cited the forthcoming U.K. General election as\nanother factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the London\nstock market.\n    \"The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a general\nelection creates just the kind that will keep them on the\nsidelines,\" one trader said.\n    There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find the\ntrack records of U.K. Companies strong enough to make them\nwilling to invest heavily. \"Our industrial and manufacturing\noutput may be looking better, but it must still look pretty\nuninspiring to the Japanese,\" one broker said.\n    Some market participants, however, are a little more\nbullish and do expect more, although not a massive amount, of\nFar Eastern funds to come to London in the short term.\n    They point out that capital gains on U.S. Bonds, a market\nin which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players, have\nbeen eroded because of the fall in the U.S. Dollar and this\ncould prompt them to move funds out of the U.S. But even those\nwho are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on the\nLondon exchange would almost certainly confine themselves to\nlonger term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues,\nwhich may include industrial giants such as ICI, Hanson Trust,\nBritish Petroleum, Glaxo and Unilever.\n    One analyst said he believed if there was such investment\nin blue chip issues, recently privatised companies such as\nBritish Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold.\n    He said that with an election coming up, overseas investors\nwould be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy of\nre-nationalisation of such companies. The Labour party has in\nthe past said it would do this.\n    Some of the recent rise in U.K. Equities has anticipated an\nincrease in Japanese buying in the near future.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Reagan\nproposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.\n    His non defence budget savings, including health, welfare,\nagricultural, government services and reduced interest\npayments, amount to 11.6 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japanese-owned Honda American\nManufacturing Co has exported the first U.S.-built cars ever\nsold overseas by a foreign-owned auto company, a Honda\nspokesman said.\n    The subsidiary of Honda Motor Co Ltd <HMC.T> of Japan\nshipped 200 of its popular Accord cars to Taiwan earlier this\nmonth, the spokesman said. The company might also eventually\nsend U.S.-made cars to Japan, he said.\n    The automaker said it would not boost its U.S. imports of\ncars from Japan, but instead make up demand for its cars in the\nU.S. by increasing U.S. production.\n    The shipment to Taiwan was part of planned shipments to\nSan-Yan Industries of Taiwan of about 2,000 Accords a year.\n    Honda said it does not make Accords in Taiwan, and is\nprevented by Taiwanese import restrictions from shipping them\nthere from Japan.\n    Those restrictions were loosened this year to allow imports\nfrom the United States. Previously no imports of foreign-built\ncars were allowed, the spokesman said.\n    The Accords were built at Honda's U.S. car and motorcycle\nproduction facility at Marysville, Ohio. Honda in the past has\nsent motorcycles from Marysville to Europe and Australia, and\nhas sent cars to Canada.\n    Honda's U.S. output would have to be adjusted to meet\nchanging U.S. demand, the spokesman said. He quoted American\nHonda president Tetsuo Chino as saying, \"Honda will not\nincrease U.S. imports beyond the current level even if\nvoluntary export restrictions on Japanese cars are lifted.\"    \n Analysts say there are few signs Japan's restrictions will be\nlifted.\n    Honda might decide by the end of this year whether to\nexpand its U.S. production, the spokesman said.\n    Honda said it is considering building either of its two new\nluxury models--the \"Legend\" or \"Integra\"--in the United States.\n    The Legend and Integra, two models of the company's Acura\nline, were introduced last March. If the cars prove popular\nenough, one of them could be built at the Ohio plant, or at a\nnew factory, the spokesman said.\n    The spokesman said it is possible Acuras built in the\nUnited States could be shipped back to Japan. However, he said\nthat decision has not yet been made, and would follow the\ndecision to build the cars in the United States.\n    If demand for either one of the two cars reaches 100,000\nvehicles a year, Honda could decide to build the cars in the\nU.S., the company said.\n    Sales of the Integra through February have outpaced the\nLegend--35,768 against 29,824--but the spokesman said Honda\nexpects sales to \"lean more heavily toward Legend\" this year\nbecause a two-door Legend has been added to the line.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

It also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee BP\npaid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existing\ndebt.\n    Earlier today a Morgan Guaranty official, while declining\nto reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be\n\"compensated fairly\" since this is a special purpose facility\nwhich must be completed quickly, with the signing expected in\nabout 10 days.\n    The facility is only being syndicated among BP's\nrelationship banks and therefore has large individual\ncommitments from the banks. Lead managers are being recruited\nat the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln and\nmanagers at 75 mln.\n    However, bankers said that despite the size it is likely\nthe financing will get done quickly since banks will want to be\nseen as supporting the relationship.\n    The financing is being arranged in the name of BP\nInternational and BP North America.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

On a current prices\nbasis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in\n1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.\n     But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in\nunemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the\nministry said.\n    The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of\nthe dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries\nsuch as Italy.\n    These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3\npct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.\n    They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.\n    On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national\nstatistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986\nof 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a\nprevious deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and\ncompares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Moody's Investors Service Inc said it\nmay downgrade British Petroleum Co PLC's 3.5 billion dlrs of\ndebt and Standard Oil Co's 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.\n    The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tender\noffer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares it\ndoes not already own.\n    Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatly\nstrengthened its capital structure over the past few years,\nthis acquisition would seriously affect the company's\nliquidity, leverage and interest coverage.\n    Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more than\ntwo billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five\nbillion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.\n    In addition, the minority interest and deferred income\ntaxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded from\nBritish Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in a\ntotal debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said.\n    The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy to\nrestore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody's\nsaid that may include divestiture of various petroleum and\nnon-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard.\n    But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown and\ndivestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewer\nnon-petroleum assets are available for sale.\n    Under review are the A-1 senior debt of issues guaranteed\nby British Petroleum, including Eurobonds of BP Capital B.V.,\ndebentures of BP North America Finance Corp, Eurodebt of\nBritish Petroleum B.V., BPCA Finance Ltd and BP Canadian\nHoldings Ltd, debentures and medium-term notes of BP North\nAmerica Inc. Also, the A-1 debt of Standard Oil and Sohio\nPipeline, and debentures of Sohio/BP Trans-Alaska Pipeline\nguaranteed severally and not jointly by B.P. and Standard.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "British Petroleum Co PLC may have to\nraise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly\ntraded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD>, analysts said.\n    \"There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other\nthey would be forced to come up with another bid,\" said Rosario\nIlaqua of L.F. Rothschild.\n    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today\nthat BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained\na distinct possibility.\n    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell\nGroup's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil\nCo in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its\ninitial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after\nlawsuits by minority shareholders.\n    \"I think they're going to have to go a little higher\neventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher\nfor the Shell Oil minority shares,\" Bruce Lazier of Prescott\nBall and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.\n    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct\nof Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After\nobjections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal\nDutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender\noffer in April 1984.\n    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the\noffer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,\nRoyal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.\n    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding\nShell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of\nabout 5.2 billion dlrs.\n    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at\na BP press conference in New York this afternoon.\n    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told\nclients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The\nanalyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.\n    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the\nRoyal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder\nlawsuits for the same reason, they said.\n    Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the\nShell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Six other people associated with the bank\nwere jailed in 1983.\n    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced\nmedical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during\nhis childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

If\nOPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average\nprice, he said, Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs.\n    Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth\nministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and\nCaribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.\n    Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico,\nTrinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day\nconference, while Colombia is present for the first time as an\nobserver.\n    Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of\nideas about the oil market. However, the members will also\ndiscuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil\ncurrently before the U.S. Congress.\n    Following the opening session, the group of ministers met\nwith President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidential\npalace. The delegations to the conference are headed by\nHernandez of Venezuela, Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of\nEcuador, Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago,\nJose Luis Alcudiai, assistant energy secretary of Mexico and\nEnergy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Farm-state senators indicated they\nmay broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid\nfor borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as\nwell as the farm credit system.\n    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate\nAgriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said\nlegislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should\nprovide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.\n    \"We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,\nprincipal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and\nranchers regardless of their lending institution,\" Boren said.\n    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.\nJames McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should\ncover all lenders to agriculture.\n    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements\nfor the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest\nfarm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and\nfrom the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the\nfocus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.\nUntil now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how\nto resurrect the failing system.\n    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as\ncommercial banks and life insurance companies must be included\nin the aid package because \"it would not be fair to address\nonly the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers.\"\n    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board\ninterest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the\nbroad approach would cost.\n    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State\nUniversity told the hearing the cost could be in the range of\n3.5 billion dlrs annually.\n    By trying to draw into the farm credit rescue package all\nfarm borrowers, Boren and other Senators appeared to be\nreacting to pressure from private lenders and their borrowers,\nwho fear they will be put at a competitive disadvantage by the\ngovernment rescue of the farm credit system and its borrowers.\n    The farm credit system is the nation's largest lender to\nagriculture with 39 pct of all farm real estate loans, but\nprivate lenders account for nearly a quarter of loans on\nfarmland and 34 pct of farm operating loans, official figures\nshow.\n    The American Bankers Association, in testimony to the\nhearing, warned the farm credit rescue should not be structured\nto favor the system over other lenders.\n    As one way to meet the concern of private lenders, several\nSenators, the farm credit system, and farm organizations\nendorsed creation of a secondary market on farm real estate\nloans, called \"aggie mae\", which is sought by private lenders.\n    \"We are also exploring the possibility of including in the\nfarm credit bill, the establishment of a secondary market for\nagricultural loans that would be available to all lenders,\"\nSen. Boren said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Top executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT>\nand Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to\ngradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on\nimports of oil from the Middle East grows.\n     \"I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a\ntrend of gradually increasing prices,\" C.W. Nance, president of\nTenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the\nPetroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.\n     Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of\nProducing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the\nrate of 80 pct of capacity.\n    The gain will come largely through increased imports to the\nUnited States, he said.\n    \"They will be able to raise the price again but I do not\nthink they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,\" Nance\nsaid. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.\n     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted\nthat world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20\ndlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in\n1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb\nfrom a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between\n1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.\n     \"Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in\nincreased demand,\" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's\noutlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law\nprohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants\nand utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15\npct, he said.\n     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may\nexperience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next\nwinter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.\n     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20\npct during 1986, he said.\n     \"This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,\" Nance said.\n\"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is\nhow broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three\nyears before we start to climb out?\"\n      J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent\nimprovement in oil prices was not enough for independent\nproducers to begin new onshore drilling projects.\n     \"If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr\nper mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore\nexploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by\nindependents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,\" Walter said.\n     He suggested that some independents may instead turn to\nexploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out\nagreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held\nfinding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,\nWalter said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Soviet economy has grown at an\nincreased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but his\ngoals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.\nintelligence agencies.\n    The report was prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence\nAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for the\nCongressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.\n    It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,\nGorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate of\ngrowth over the previous 10 years.\n    Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, remove\nincompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism and\nmodernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for some\nof the gains, the report said.\n    \"Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev has\nadopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to his\nefforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-term\nsolutions are attributes that his immediate predecessors\nlacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitious\non a number of counts,\" the report said.\n    Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Union\nsaid Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four years\nif he continues his reform policies.\n    \"I don't think he can last four years,\" Marshall Goldman of\nHarvard University told a Congressional hearing. \"He's moving so\nfast, he's stepping on so many toes.\"\n    A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of the\nSmithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian\nstudies.\n    The economic report said meeting targets for commodity\noutput would require unrealistic gains in productivity and\nindustrial output targets appear too high to allow time to\ninstall more advanced equipment.\n    None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system of\neconomic incentives that has discouraged innovation and\ntechnological change, the report added.\n    \"The first significant resistance to specific policies,\nalthough not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both the\nmassive government and party bureaucracy, particularly among\nenterprise managers who complained that they were being asked\nto carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise quality\nstandards and output targets simultaneously,\" the report said.\n    The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in the\nSoviet economy over the next several years. It said the Soviet\nUnion trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advanced\nmanufacturing technologies, such as computers and\nmicroprocessors.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Management intends to include the charge and writedown\nin response to the preliminary findings.\n    Great American said regulatory authorities are not\nrequiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial\nresults for Great American for 1986.\n    However, Great American has revised its previous estimates\nof provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to\nthe allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took\nthe action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its\nallowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment\ndoes not show signs for significant improvement in the near\nfuture.\n    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to\n26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan\nportfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.\n    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth\nquarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a\nnet loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year\nearlier.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Senate Agriculture Committee\nChairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Congress would consider\nlimiting the use of generic commodity certificates as a means\nof cutting government spending.\n     \"I suspect that as we go into some of the budget debates\nwe're going to have on the floor, this is going to be part of\nit,\" Leahy said, referring to proposals that the U.S.\nAgriculture Department save money by substituting cash outlays\nfor payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates in price and income\nsupport programs.\n     \"I have a feeling that the PIK program, however the cost\nis defined, is going to be one of the top number of areas that\npeople are going to be looking for savings,\" Leahy told a\nhearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n     The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the\ngovernment could save 1.4 billion dlrs during fiscal years\n1988-92 if it curbed the use of generic certificates by banning\nso-called \"PIK and roll\" transactions.\n     Several Democratic senators had harsh comments for generic\ncertificates.\n     \"We're trying to take care of a bad situation --\nsurpluses--by depressing the price. I don't see any benefits,\"\nsaid Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). \"I don't see any benefit in\ndriving their prices lower, lower, lower all the time.\"\n     But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he supported use of\ncertificates. \"By and large I'm favorably impressed by PIK\ncertificates. I feel they have been helpful,\" said Boschwitz.\n     As expected, officials from the General Accounting Office\nand the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated their estimates\nof the cost of PIK certificates compared to cash outlays were\nfar apart.\n     The General Accounting Office, GAO, told the committee\nthat PIK certificates increased total Commodity Credit Corp\noutlays through 1987 by between 107 mln and 653 mln dlrs. GAO\nsaid that increase was offset by commodity storage cost savings\nof beween 169 mln and 253 mln dlrs.\n     Pressed by the committee, GAO Senior Associate Director\nBrian Crowley said government spending probably was about 450\nmln dlrs above what it would have been had all program payments\nbeen made in cash, not counting storage savings.\n     Crowley also said he thought PIK certificates had lowered\nthe price of corn and boosted domestic consumption of corn.\n     Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz told the\ncommittee that the additional costs of using PIK certificates\nand storage, handling and transportation costs \"balance off\nvery closely.\"\n     Amstutz said he estimated the net cost of using\ncertificates was about one pct higher than using only cash to\nmake program payments.\n     William Bailey, USDA deputy administrator for program\nplanning, said there were \"one hundred issues I find either\nincorrect (in the GAO report), disagree with or where their\n(GAO) facts are inconsistent with what's going on.\"\n     Amstutz said GAO had not given USDA the option of\n\"providing input\" into the preparation of their report \"as they\nfrequently do.\"\n     The USDA undersecretary also conceded that certificates\nand marketing loans had the similar effect of \"putting more\ngoods into the market,\" but that while the department supported\ncertificates, it would continue to oppose a marketing loan for\nwheat and feedgrains because it would cost too much.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

There was no immediate response from Luanda.\n    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan government\nsince 1976.\n    The offer of a rail route to the Atlantic would help South\nAfrica's black neighbors reduce their economic dependence on\nSouth Africa.\n    The U.S. Congress is currently considering a proposal to\nspend some 500 mln dlrs to build another railroad to help these\nstates become less dependent on South Africa.\n    The Beira corridor runs through Mozambique to Tanzania's\nIndian ocean ports but Savimbi suggested the Benguela route as\nan alternative.\n    \"The Benguela route can safely open immediately,\" he said. \"It\nwill provide the transportation our neighbors need, and it will\nnot cost the Americans the money they say it will cost to open\nthe Beira corridor.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Federal Reserve data released today\nindicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks\nand that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.\n    \"The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of\nreserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since\nthe beginning of this year,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at\nWells Fargo Bank.\n    \"These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not\nchange policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.\n    \"The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real\nreason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\nWarburg and Co Inc.\n    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\nnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\nmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern\nnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\nheavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\nthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\ninterest rates further.\n    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\nexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\n    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\ndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\nversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\n    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the\ndiscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\ncompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\nperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\n6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\n    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\nand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\nreleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\n    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any\npressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\nboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\nmeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\n    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\nborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\naveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\nwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\n    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\ntwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\ndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\naround 6.10 pct.\n    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\ntarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\nWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\nthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\n6-1/4 pct band.\n    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\nare anticipated for the statement period that began today.\n More\n    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\nbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\nputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\n    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\nadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\nbuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\ncoupon \"pass\" may be required later.\n    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\nperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\nupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\ndressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Substantial difficulties faced by the\nU.S. farm credit system can be solved with a business-like\napproach to the problems, a Farm Credit Admimistration official\nsaid.\n    Marvin R. Duncan, a member of the administration board,\nsaid the farm credit system faces unprecedented difficulties in\nits 70-year history.\n    Addressing Chicago business and agricultural economists,\nDuncan outlined three basic problems of the farm credit system.\nThose include the high cost of its debt, the quality of its\nassets, and the management of its credit delivery system.\n    He said some of the system's debt carries interest rates as\nhigh as 15.65 pct and will not mature until the year 2007.\n    Of its 54.6 mln dlrs in assets, 24.1 pct are non-accrual,\nhigh risk or already forfeited property, which led to losses in\n1986 of 1.9 billion dlrs and in 1985 of 2.7 billion dlrs.\n    Problems with credit delivery have been somewhat resolved,\nhe said.\n    \"The system is still plagued with duplication in layers of\nmanagement and decision-making, inadequate tailoring of credit\nservices to fit the emerging market, a large investment in\nbricks and mortar, and a management and directorate more\ninsular to the marketplace than that of its competitors,\" he\nsaid.\n    He said solutions to the problems should -\n - provide assurances to farmers on borrowers stock and the\nstability of the farm credit system.\n - maintain confidence of investors who buy system securities.\n - address the high cost of the system's existing debt.\n - enable the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation to carry\nout its role as a workout bank.\n    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,\nsaid this week that the system may lose as much as 1.4 billion\ndlrs this year, and another board member, Jim Billington, said\nCongress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning\nlate this year to bail out the system.\n    Duncan noted that the system has about 70 billion dlrs in\nassets, serves about 800,000 individual borrowers and 3,000\ncooperatives, and has 62.5 billion dlrs in securities\noutstanding.\n    \"With a business-like solution to its problems, it can\ncontinue that role for generations into the future,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It would, however,\nincrease inflation and reduce world trade,\" it said.\n    \"The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient\ndomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would\nremain,\" the report said.\n    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year\nbecause of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West\nEuropean nations as they adjust production and workforces to a\nlow dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third\nWorld debt management and looming protectionism.\n    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of\nJapan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.\n    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes\nwere not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.\n    \"Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced\nas a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not\nborne out last year,\" the report said.\n    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the\nU.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly\nexpanding money supply and low dollar.\n    \"Such a development could worsen the business climate by\nincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in\nturn, would adversely affect world trade.\"\n    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the\nUnited States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes\nforeign products more expensive.\n    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human\nand in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the\ngoods and services sought from abroad.\n    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,\nabout half of the rate of the previous year.\n    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,\ncontinuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT\nsaid.\n    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while\ntheir imports increased moderately, although full statistics\nare not available yet, GATT said.\n    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations\nwere sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,\nPhilippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "India is searching for non-communist\ncountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and\nconserve foreign exchange.\n    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and\nelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are\nall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,\nchemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.\n    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in\n1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading\nCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).\n    \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their\nbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian\nexports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that\nprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.\n    One trade source said India has targetted countries that\ndepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign\nimports.\n    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part\nof India's total trading and are likely to account for less\nthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade\nduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.\n    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65\nbillion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,\nagainst almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.\n    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern\nBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.\n    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of\nagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude\noil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,\nagainst three billion in 1985/86.\n    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help\nnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is still\ninsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,\nVenezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.\n    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion\nin the current fiscal year.\n    But the push to include non-communist countries in\ncountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow\ngrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,\nshrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.\n    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting\ncountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made\ndiscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot\nofficially support bartering.\n    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore\nexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.\n    \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that\npreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind\nfor goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said,\nadding that the policy remains flexible.\n    \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at\nwhich the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade\nofficial said.\n    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign\ncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs\nand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance\nif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade\nsources said.\n    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean\nfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln\ndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.\n    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy\nIndian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct\nsought by New Delhi, the trade official said.\n    \"We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,\"\nhe added.\n    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign\ncurrency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to\nbuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in\nexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.\n    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some\ninherent problems, they added.\n    \"It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that\nthe trade should always be balanced,\" one trade source said. \"The\nother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy\ncommodities which the other party wants.\"\n    Another added, \"Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it\nas a temporary measure to get over the current balance of\npayments difficulty.\n    \"This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.\nIt does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The president of Japan's biggest high\ntechnology firm, NEC Corp <NIPN.T>, is anything but worried,\ndespite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, and\na stagnant world electronics market.\n    \"The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,\"\nTadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction and\nglobalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.\nThere's no need to change our strategy now.\"\n    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,\nthe tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most high\ntechnology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it is\nto survive.\n    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turning\nits focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,\nSekimoto said.\n    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan \"C and C\" (Computers\nand Communications) to create high level home electronics that\ngo beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimoto\nsaid.\n    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC's\ntotal 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in the\nyear ended March 31, 1986.\n    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be a\nmajor growth market in the future, but some warn the company\nfaces some stiff competition.\n    \"This is where the market is going to be for a long time --\nin products that combine personal computers, video display and\ntelecommunications networks,\" said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd\nanalyst Carole Ryavec. \"But Matsushita (Electric Industrial Co\nLtd) may be there first.\"\n    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carry\nthe day.\n    \"Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchips\nor telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.\nNEC is unique in that respect,\" he said.\n    To help its already high rankings, NEC will further\nincrease the high level of offshore production which makes it\none of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.\n    The company will increase offshore output of all goods it\nsells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the next\nseveral years, Sekimoto said.\n    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,\ndespite moving last year to become joint owner, along with\nFrance's Cie des Machines Bull <BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm Honeywell\nInc's <HON> Information Systems unit.\n    \"We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market through\nthe Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take an\nindependent and autonomous route,\" said Sekimoto.\n    The company also plans to maintain its independent line by\ncontinuing to make computers which are not compatible with\nthose of International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, he said.\n    \"Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caught\nin software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits and\nmarket share have gradually expanded,\" Sekimoto said.\n    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers are\nperfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. \"What will\nmatter is the best hardware, the best software and the best\nability to meet customers needs,\" Sekimoto said.\n    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personal\ncomputer market, may go to court to stop competitors selling\ncheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringe\ncopyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.\n    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for looking\nahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchip\ndemand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left with\nserious excess capacity when lean years followed the boom\ntimes.\n    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment in\nthe sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spending\nagain, if only slightly.\n    \"We're not going to increase production. But we are going to\ninvest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,\"\nhe said.\n    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the company\nfaces tough times due to stagnant markets.\n    \"NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, but\nthey are caught in a downturn which may last a long time,\" said\nSalamon's Ryavec.\n    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent net\nprofits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,\ndown 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expected\nto rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.\n    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38\nbillion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd\n<JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new \"B\" shares\nof 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two\ndlrs.\n    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total\n1987 dividend of four cents per \"B\" share, while the \"A\" share\ndividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a\nshare.\n    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986\nnet profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.\n    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from\n4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.\n    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson\nachieved the good performance through satisfactory results in\nmost sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>,\nJardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.\n    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong\nLand, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a\nreorganisation, is \"a long term investment and now stands at a\nlevel which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset\nimbalance.\"\n    Keswick said the issue of new \"B\" shares will give the group\n\"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for\nexpansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which\nhas been brought about through the group's recent\nrestructuring.\"\n    He said the new issue is pending approval from both the\nfirm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate\nadjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.\n    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,\nwith Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to\nthe new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.\n    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two\ncompanies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental\nInternational Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>\n-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.\n    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs\nlast year, will become debt free after the restructuring.\n    \"A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,\ncontinuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,\"\nKeswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in\nairfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking\nbusiness, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.\n    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its\ngeneral trading business in the Middle East in view of the\ncontinuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said\nthe operations would be profitable in the longer term.\n    He said the firm's function \"has evolved into one primarily\nof strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.\"\n    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board\nof directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific\nregional board. He gave no further details of the change.\n    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at\nmidday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had\nfallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm\nplanned a rights issue.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The share price would be determined according to\nmarket conditions, but its expected that it would be at the\nmiddle market price.\n    A Fisons statement said that although the pharmaceutical\ngroup achieved more than 80 pct of its sales outside the U.K.,\nWith rapidly increasing interest from international investors,\nless than two pct of its shares were held overseas.\n    The issue would help meet this interest, enhance the\ngroup's standing in the capital markets and increase demand for\nits shares. The issue would also be a cost effective way of\nraising new equity, it said.\n    The new funds would be used for the developing of existing\noperations and also for acquisitions if suitable opportunities\narose.\n    The issue, which represents 5.5 pct of the company's\nauthorised capital, requires shareholder approval.

        "body": "Philippine sugar production in the\n1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,\nup from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar\nRegulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.\n    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling\nseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate\nwould almost certainly be met.\n    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would\nbe earmarked for domestic consumption.\n    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the\nU.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and\n50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.\n    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA\nrecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take\nup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.\n    \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying\napproval of the project, but we expect it to come through by\nJuly,\" Yulo said.\n    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil\nimport bill by about 300 mln pesos.\n    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to\nstart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.\n    The ethanol project would result in employment for about\n100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by\ndepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.\n    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had\nbeen submitted to President Corazon Aquino.\n    \"I think the President would rather wait till the new\nCongress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there\nis really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing\njust slightly over our own consumption level.\"\n    \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo\nsaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos\nper picul, up from 190 pesos last August.\n    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation\nfollowing the SRA's bid to control production.\n    \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\"\nhe said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from\ntheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and\ncloth production.\n    He said diversification into products other than ethanol\nwas also possible within the sugar industry.\n    \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said.\n\"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they\nrelocated many of them and diversified production. We want to\ncall this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\"\n    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used\nfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.\n    \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce\nsugar,\" he said.\n    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the\nInternational Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.\n    \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new\nagreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.\n    \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be\ndepressed, particularly because the European Community is\nsubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\"\n    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60\ncents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where\nproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.\n    \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I\nexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end\nof this year,\" he said.\n    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by\n1990, with world consumption outstripping production.\n    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments\nfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.\n    \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he\nsaid. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the\nU.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut\nours in half without any justification.\"\n    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut\ndomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its\n12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to\n143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.\n    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,\nsome Philippine mills were expected to shut down.\n    \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the\n1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow\nsuit during the next season.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Merrill Lynch and Co\nInc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both of\nthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.\n    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the\nmerger of the two firms because it says the market can only\nsupport a single KDD competitor.\n    It has also rejected management participation by an\ninternational common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,\narguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.\n    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan\nSolomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a\nmerger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to\nless than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20\npct, the ministry official said.\n    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor\nwould most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'\nshare, industry analysts said.\n    \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one\ncombined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst\nDarrell Whitten said.\n    \"Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up\nto a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an\nextraordinarily large holding,\" Whitten said.\n    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.\n    \"They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless\nwith a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of\nstrategies to reduce that share,\" one said.\n    Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business\norganization) official who has been trying to arrange the\nmerger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,\nthe ministry official said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> said it expected to\nmake an announcement next week which would have a significant\nand beneficial impact on the future of the company.\n    It said the statement was prompted by heavy turnover in CSR\nshares. Brokers said Bond Corp Holdings Ltd <BONA.S> today sold\n24.2 mln CSR shares representing almost five pct of the\ncompany. CSR closed 20 cents higher at 4.20 dlrs on a national\nturnover of 31.39 mln shares.\n    Share analysts said the CSR announcement could be about the\nexpected flotation of its <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd> unit,\nreleasing cash for a major building products aquisition.\n    CSR forecast in January it would float Delhi and said it\nexpected to invest close to 100 mln dlrs on acquisitions in\nbuilding materials both in Australia and offshore.\n    One analyst, who asked not to be named, said about 25 pct\nof Delhi could be offered to CSR shareholders in an arrangement\nwhich would preserve the tax position of the Cooper Basin oil\nand gas producer, which is held in a trust.\n    CSR had now finished paying for Delhi, after last year\nwriting down large foreign exchange losses on loans to buy the\ncompany and selling such investments as its share of the Mount\nNewman iron ore project, the analyst said.\n    CSR had restructured its management in recent months and\nwas redirecting its efforts into industrial divisions from its\nresources business, analysts told Reuters. It could be expected\nto also float its coal interests, they said.\n    The company earlier this month said it would sell its five\nSydney head office buildings.\n    Stuart McKibbin of Melbourne broker <A.C. Goode and Co Ltd>\nsaid CSR had till now been overlooked by many of the offshore\ninvestors now heavily buying Australian gold and resource\nstocks. That climate could prove an ideal time to float the CSR\npetroleum division, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

An expected German mark appreciation against the\ndollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its\nvalue relative to the German currency, he said.\n    DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products\nshould grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2\npct increase.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

On that basis, the trade\nsurplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from\na record 9.58 billion in January.\n    \"In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to\ncontinue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off\nfurther protectionism or further yen strength,\" said William\nStirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.\n    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on\nworld markets while making imports into the country cheaper.\n    \"On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some\nprogress on getting exports down,\" Jardine's Rasmussen said.\n    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the\nJapanese economy remains sluggish, he said.\n    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower\nimport growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked\noff stocks they had built up in January.\n    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of\nexports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase\nin January.\n    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen\nagainst the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact\non exports, they said.\n    But economists warned that may not be soon enough for\nJapan's trading partners.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Recent slackness on Dutch capital\nmarkets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's\npolicy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark\nand to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.\n    While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the\nguilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use\nof the range within which the guilder and the mark can\nfluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System\n(EMS).\n    Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV\n(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.\n    \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the\nrange given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the\npresentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.\n    Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against\nthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.\n    The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to\nkeep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a\nstable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\npolicies to influence the exchange rate.\n    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\naims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\n    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\n    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\nmaintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\nexpectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\nsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\nobtain.\"\n    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\nrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\nsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\nmarket. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\nabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\nadded.\n    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\na price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\nBank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\nnoting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\nthe mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\n    \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\nbetween West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\n    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\nNetherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\nbetween the two countries, as the economic performance of the\ntwo does not differ much, economists said.\n    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\nNetherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\naccounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\ncountries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\nDutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\n    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\nand exchange rates.\n    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading\npartner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\nimports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\nStatistics figures show.\n    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\ntrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\nrate of around 5-7/16 pct.\n    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\neven rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\n1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\n    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\ndecrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\nCentral Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\nGerman GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\nbetween zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\n    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\ndealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\nindependently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\n    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\nthe Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\npct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\nsurcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\nexpected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\n    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\non the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\n    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\npolicies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\nnarrow.\n    \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\nbetween the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the\nmargin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell\nlarge amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director\nJan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.\n    \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the\nmarkets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.\nWe want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the\nmark,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The German auction system of shares\ntrading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallel\nto off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the \"Big\nBang,\" Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.\n    Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if the\nFrankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurt\nexchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and was\ninvesting 86 mln marks in renovating its building. A\nscreen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be in\nplace too.\n    The nature of the auction system limited how far trading\nhours could be extended from the present two-hour session.\n    Other practical problems inhibited the German ability to\nfollow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices,\nwere under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meant\ntransfer of securities control to an independent body, if\ndesired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.\n    \"Shorting\" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rules\nfor pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lent\nout for the kind of speculative positions taken by London\nmarket makers.\n    But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised for\nbeing too distant from those it should serve.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Soviet officials said foreign\nbusinessmen are expressing strong interest in establishing\njoint enterprises in the Soviet Union and already 30\npreliminary agreements had been signed with Western firms.\n    But Western economic experts described foreign business\ninterest as cautious and noted that no final contracts had been\nsealed to set up joint ventures on Soviet territory.\n    Moscow last year invited companies in socialist, developing\nand capitalist countries to start joint ventures as part of a\nprogramme to open up the Soviet Union's foreign trade ties.\n    At the same time, a number of Soviet ministries and\nenterprises received the right to deal directly on world\nmarkets. Previously the Ministry of Foreign Trade monopolised\nall import and export business.\n    Explaining the changes at a news conference today, Deputy\nPrime Minister Vladimir Kamentsev said they had received a\nmixed reaction in the foreign press but a warm response from\nbusinessmen.\n    Over 200 proposals for establishing joint ventures had been\nreceived from foreign firms, 121 of which had been judged of\nmutual interest, he said.\n    Thirty protocols had been signed and 12 projects were\n\"practically implemented,\" including ventures with Finnish,\nJapanese, West German and American firms, he added.\n    But Western diplomats specialising in Soviet economic\naffairs said the protocols were not legally binding and not a\nsingle contract had been finalised.\n    \"The Soviet Union is selling the joint venture idea very\nhard because it wants to obtain new technology cheaply, but I\nwould say business reaction in the West has been cool so far,\"\ncommented one diplomat.\n    Asked why this was so, he said the rules for running joint\nventures were still unclear and no Western firm wanted to be\nthe first to take a major financial risk.\n    Kamentsev, flanked by Foreign Trade Minister Boris Aristov,\nForeign Trade Bank Chairman Yuri Ivanov and other officials,\nrepeated terms for the establishment of joint ventures,\nincluding the ground-rule that the Soviet side must have a\nstake of at least 51 pct in any enterprise.\n    He said some businessmen had the mistaken impression that\nforeign partners could only take profits from the products\nwhich their enterprises exported.\n    \"I would like to stress that the foreign partner can take\nprofits from all the products which his venture produces\naccording to his share of the capital,\" Kamentsev said.\n    He added that the Soviet Union was interested in \"long-term\nand stable contacts\" with foreign firms and was offering a\nnumber of tax breaks to companies which invested here.\n    Speaking about the reform giving individual Soviet trading\norganisations more autonomy, Kamentsev said 21 ministries and\n75 enterprises now had the right to deal for themselves on\nworld markets.\n    Organisations enjoying this right handled 25 pct of total\nSoviet trade including 40 pct of trade in machines and tools,\nhe said.\n    The Ministry of Foreign Trade continued to conduct business\nfor the remaining ministries and state enterprises and\nsupervised trade in essential products such as food.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will\nvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.\nAnger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said\nthey believed his chances of success were slim.\n    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and\nwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be\nhard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.\nPresident Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.\n    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided\nwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus\nlast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.\n    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's\nEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action\nagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint\ntrade agreement on computer microchips.\n    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one\ndesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the\nshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium\nterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.\n    But government officials said political infighting could\nrob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent\none from seeing the light of day.\n    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up\na package of short-term economic measures until after its\n1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would\namount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.\n    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for\nhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by\nopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.\n    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the\nU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling\nLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own\nmeasures.\n    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis\nof the government's plans, without losing face in parliament\nover the budget, political analysts said.\n    Officials working on the government's short-term economic\npackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts on\nloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to\npass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in\nthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.\n    They said a record portion of state investment planned for\nthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first\nhalf, probably over 80 pct.\n    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy\nReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.\nCongress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade\ndeficit.\n    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also\nlikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term\neconomic plans.\n    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan\ngovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final\nreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days\nbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.\n    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to\nMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are\nlikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as\nagricultural reform and land policy, officials said.\n    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed\nas possible, they said the political realities might force them\nto water down some of the committee's recommendations.\n    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy\nmight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes\nmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee\nprojects that the current account surplus will fall to less\nthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national\nproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which\nmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct\nof gnp.\n    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for\nJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual\nappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around\n1993, from 150 now.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake\nin Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and\nanalysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent\nit occurring.\n    The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow\nboth receiving shares in a new company <Astral Pacific Corp\nLtd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.\n    The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would\noffer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full\nbid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between\nBIL and Rainbow.\n    BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he\nopposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees\nProgressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.\nBIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.\n    Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman\nAllan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only\nat dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of\nProgressive shareholders.\n    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the\nmerger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce\nCommission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's\nscrutiny.\n    Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 and\nBIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading\ntoday.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Reports the Soviet Union has lately\nextended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight\nraws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under\nNew York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for\nsugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.\n    The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,\nTurkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.\n    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in\ncurrent activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which\npreviously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.\n    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet\nUnion in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling\nThai origin sugar.\n    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened\nconsiderably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly\nfor sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block\nenquiries by China, they said.\n    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to\naround 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts\npreviously, they added.\n    Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more\nsugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement\nthis year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some\n1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.\n    Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000\ntonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of\ntwo to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost\nand freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer\nthis week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an\nundisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around\n229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.\n    Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer\nphysicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged\nrecently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders\nsaid.\n    Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of\nwhites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled\nfor tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.\n    Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white\nsugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender\nfor 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for\narrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The spokesman said this would enable distribution of\nflour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate\nnext month.\n    He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most\naspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,\nwill be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.\n    Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European\ncurrency units, would be a major consideration.\n    End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,\n520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

As a member of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot\nofficially support bartering.\n    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore\nexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.\n    \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that\npreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind\nfor goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said,\nadding that the policy remains flexible.\n    \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at\nwhich the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade\nofficial said.\n    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign\ncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs\nand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance\nif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade\nsources said.\n    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean\nfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln\ndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Swiss National Bank bought dollars\nagainst yen today, a spokesman for the bank said.\n    He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when\nprecisely it intervened.\n    Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National\nBank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than\n20 or 30 mln dlrs.\n    The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars\nagainst the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks\nas well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan\ndollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.\n    Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impression\nthat major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting\non an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market\nseemed ready to test it.\n    Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the\nyen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew\ncloser. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked for\nMarch 31.\n    One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had\nbeen asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this\npoint, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request,\nwere offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if\nthe dollar fell further.\n    The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market\nthinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting\nin Hamburg.\n    Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other\nthan the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the\nday.\n    The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to\nintervene in support of the dollar. \"But they will probably do\nit only half-heartedly, so I don't think it will matter too\nmuch on rates,\" one dealer said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

An attack on a warship is a cause for war.\" But he\nadded \"We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the\nmilitary are directed towards protecting our rights.\"\n    Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights\nin the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the\ndispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.\n    Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told\nreporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions\nAthens had attached.\n    In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the\nTurkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations \"we will\nhinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped\nwith words.\"\n    Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and\nnavy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman\nYannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only \"The Greek\nfleet is not at its naval base.\"\n    Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct\nof the areas proposed for research were on the Greek\ncontinental shelf.\n    Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part\nin orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to\nnegotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept\nit.\n    Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not\nnegotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in\nthe Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.\n    He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be\npossible for Greece to discuss the future of American military\nbases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases\nin Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied \"Obviously,\nand perhaps even before the war.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Sports carmaker Dr. Ing. H.C.F.\nPorsche AG <PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactory\nprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower but\nU.S. Sales anticipated higher.\n    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales\nwere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from\n11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000\nfrom 28,670 last year.\n    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Last\nmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70\nmln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.\n    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume this\nyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,\nSchutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were\nbased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he\nadded.\n    The expected drop in West German sales this year would be\nthe result of the so-called \"grey market\" for Porsche cars, he\nsaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many\nPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal\nexport to the U.S.\n    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87\nfirst half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.\n    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger\npercentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose\nproblems for profit, the Porsche board said.\n    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around\n20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time\nPorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the\n1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.\n    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln\nmarks.\n    In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party\norders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in\nWeissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for\nthe first time.\n    Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in\n1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The non-member cocoa issue has\nbeen among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.\n    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier\nproposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates\nsaid. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member\ncocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.\n    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of\nprice differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into\nthe buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could\nfairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to\nhim.\n    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between\nthe origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move\nsome delegates described as \"just fiddling.\"\n    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease\nsome countries that were not satisfied with the original\nproposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.\n    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any\nday would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or\nforward positions, delegates said.\n    If the compromise is accepted by the council, most\nconsumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect\nnext week, or as soon as practically possible.\n    The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to\ndiscuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all\nparties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet\nbefore the council.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They\nwill be underwriting six mln dlrs each instead of 10 mln dlrs.\n    Co-managers are Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Ka Wah Bank,\nKyowa Bank, Saitama Bank, Sanwa Bank and Yasuda Trust and\nBanking Co Ltd. They will be underwriting three mln dlrs each\ninstead of five mln dlrs. BT Asia Ltd is junior co-manager with\na two mln dlr commitment.\n    Westpac launched the facility early this month at 200 mln\ndlrs but soon reduced it to 100 mln dlrs and amended the terms\ndue to the market's cool response. The underwriting margin was\nraised to 10 basis points over the Australian dlr bank bill\nrate. Originally the margin was set at 6.25 basis points for up\nto 50 mln dlrs and at 2.5 basis points for the remainder.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Commercial\nUnion is the first U.K. Company to set up such a program.\n    Cameron-Smail said the company seeks to help the\ndevelopment of such a market as it would provide a new funding\nbase for its medium term assets.\n     Cameron-Smail said that aside from traditional lines of\nbusiness, Commercial Union would like to move into other areas\nwhere it may not be able to fund the assets itself. \"This (the\nmedium term note program) will be the platform for developing\nthose assets,\" he said.\n    He said Commercial Union will work closely with dealers for\nthe note program to find the right pricing level to satisfy\ninvestor demands. The program will be investor driven, he\nnoted, adding that the company wants the notes placed with end\ninvestors and not traded in the secondary market.\n    Commercial Union will be able to issue medium term notes in\nU.S. Dollars or sterling, with the dollar notes listed in\nLuxembourg, while the sterling notes will be listed in London.\n    Bankers expect that the maturities will be concentrated in\nthe one to five year area.\n    The dealers for the program are Barclays de Zoete Wedd,\nCredit Suisse First Boston Ltd, Goldman Sachs International,\nSwiss Bank Corporation International Ltd and S.G. Warburg and\nCo Ltd.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Lego, senior executive vice president told the\nanalysts \"our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr\nacquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.\nDespite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition\nthat has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will\nconsider it.\" He said the company would consider an acquisition\ncandidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's\nprimiary businesses.\n    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key\nareas including defense electronics, financial services,\nbroadcasting, electrical products and services for construction\nand industrial and utility markets.\n    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow\nfaster than the markets the corportation serves and \"surely\nfaster than GNP.\"\n    He said earnings per share growth is expected to\nconsistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and\nreturn on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.\n    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,\ntold the analysts \"we will consider buying back stock\" but\nthere are no current plans for such a buyback.\n    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings\nit could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that\nWestinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder\nvalue.\n    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs\nrestructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,\nassett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company\nspent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344\nmln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in\n1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400\nmln dlrs in 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

One Japanese\ninvestor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said.\n    Later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct of\nsubscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. Rabobank\nfinally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions.\n    \"We simply did not expect prices to rise so much,\" a Rabobank\nspokesman said.\" Since the pricing, the bond price index has\nrisen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallen\naccordingly to 6.04 pct.\n    Two weeks ago, Rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pct\nbond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loan\nyields that day of 6.35 pct.

That could be done under the government's\nproposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.\n    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal\nin London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based\nfirms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.\n    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain\nan alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied\nunder legally-binding international trade agreements.\n    \"The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry\nSecretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in\ninvestment, banking and insurance,\" one official said.\n    \"This point has been made to the Japanese at official level\na number times,\" the official added.\n    Britain and France are now working together to urge that\nthe European Community take collective action against Japan,\nbut by working within EC treaties, another official said.\n    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio\ninterview that the European Community should build barriers\nagainst Japanese imports through certification procedures\nsimilar to those facing European exporters in Japan.\n    \"There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,\" he\nsaid, adding \"(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.\"\nClark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade\n\"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a\nfair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is\nitself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our\nown domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.\"\n    The situation is only likely to worsen following news that\nJapan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more\nthan 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs\nfrom 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.\n    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible\ntrade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.\n    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial\ninstitutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather\nthan larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global\nbusiness centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest\nsecurities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.\n    In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan\nwas ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for\nbreaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.\n    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on\nthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb\nJapanese exports to the United States but officials said the\nmove could come today or early next week.\n    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan\nincluded tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which\nuse semiconductors.\n REUTER\n\n\n\u0003",

The latter stock is free of tax to residents\nabroad (FOTRA).\n    The bonds will be available to the U.K. Government bond\nmarket from Monday at certified prices of 113.00 stg pct for\nthe 2-1/2s of 2011 and 85-24/32 stg pct for the 2-1/2s of 2024.\n    Several dealers had expected the Bank of England to\nannounce further issues of index-linked bonds today in the\nlight of strength seen in this sector of the market over the\npast few days. Some prices advanced by as much as 1-1/2 points\nyesterday as the rest of the market eased back further.\n    However, one or two traders expressed surprise that the\nauthorities had issued further bonds of any kind in the light\nof the nervous conditions prevailing in the market.\n    In such relatively small amounts, the new issues were\nunlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on Government\nbond prices in general, dealers said.\n    Prices of index-linked bonds fell back slightly after the\nstock tranches were announced, with the 2-1/2 pct index-linked\nstock due 2016 quoted at 102-25/32 stg pct after 102-29/32\nshortly before the announcement.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It did not immediately\ndisclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.\n    The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely\naffect working capital position, future cash flows or the\ncompany's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it\nsaid.\n    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of\ncosts concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln\nU.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other\nmine developments.\n    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the\nSummitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the\nlife of the mine and charged against future earnings.\n    The change will also result in lower depreciation and\namortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an\nounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total\nestimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.\n    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is\nexpected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent\nproduction since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000\nounces.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Book value at the time will determine\nthe move's pricing, Honeywell said.\n    Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson\nSpencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's\nrestructuring.\n    \"As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and\ncontrols for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,\nHoneywell is now focusing its management, technical and\nfinancial resources on high market share business,\" Spencer\nsaid.\n    Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest\ncustomer, purchasing computers for its own internal data\nprocessing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and\nindustrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.\ngovernement.\n    Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a\nwholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named\nHoneywell Federal Systems Inc.\n    Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued\noperation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on\na cost basis, recording any dividends as received.\n    Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product\nline and build its business in integrated systems for\nnetworking, database management and transaction processing.\n    The new company said its board will have nine members,\nincluding the chairman and chief executive officer.\n    Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the\nnew company, which began worldwide operations today, said.\n    It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief\nexecutive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of\nthe board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice\npresident of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president\nand chief executive officer.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "New Irish Prime Minister Charles\nHaughey, faced with a debt-ridden economy, will have to produce\na harsh budget next week to impress financial markets, appease\npolitical opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power,\nanalysts said.\n    For Haughey, who failed to win an overall majority in last\nmonth's election, only scraped back into power when the speaker\nin parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tied\nvote on who would be the next Prime Minister.\n    Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnant\neconomy weighed down by debt, he has little room for manoeuvre.\n    The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts --\n10,000 dlrs for every man, woman and child on the island and\nper capita three times the size of Mexico's.\n    Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in the\nEuropean Community and 30,000 youngsters emigrate every year.\nThe 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again.\n    Haughey, declining to be tied down on specifics, promised\non the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap with\nan annual growth rate of 2.5 pct, compared to central bank\npredictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority, he said.\n    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out any\nincrease in the level of government borrowing and forecast\n\"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the\nboard.\"\n    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of\nthe 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual\npublic wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.\n    \"The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the\nnettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget,\" said Kevin Barry,\neconomist with National and City Brokers.\n    \"You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)\nsubstantially and swiftly. He has to do it now,\" Barry said.\n    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, he\nsaid \"Two billion would be good news. The markets are already\ntaking the view it is going to be tough.\"\n    \"He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend to\nstimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in the\nshort-term.\"\n    But he, like other analysts, rules out a debt-servicing\ncrisis that would mean calling in the International Monetary\nFund (IMF). \"It's too easy to borrow aboard,\" he added.\n    The steady rise of sterling, the currency of one of\nIreland's main trading partners, has been a boost to Irish\nexporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt trade\nsurplus in February, the 10th surplus in a row.\n    Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the punt\nbecause the main political parties are all essentially\nconservative with no major economic policy switches expected.\n    New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who replaced ousted Prime\nMinister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main opposition\nparty, has pledged to back Haughey's budget if, as expected, he\ngets tough.\n    Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would have\nto rely on the support of independent deputies if all four\nopposition parties united to vote against him.\n    But in today's climate of economic austerity, few\npoliticians would risk returning to the polls so soon and\nHaughey could cling to power for at least another two years if\nhe brings in a belt-tightening budget next week, political\ncommentators say.\n    The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation,\npushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimate\ndream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north.\n    H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the most\nsuccessful Irishmen in international business, stressed the\nneed for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing \"many of\nour children have lost faith in the future.\"\n    \"Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a\nprecipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economy\nand on the provision of services by our government would be\ncatastrophic,\" he said.\n    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its\nmeans with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that\ncould not be financed by economic growth.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

This transaction was seen as a test of a\ntechnology-sharing agreement signed by Prime Minister Rajiv\nGandhi and President Reagan in 1985.\n    The American concern was that the advanced technology might\nfall into the hands of the Soviet Union, which is India's main\nweapons supplier.\n    One condition calls for U.S. personnel to service the\ncomputer in India for three years, a Pentagon spokesman said.\n    The spokesman predicted the negotiations, which also\ninvolved the State Department, could be quickly resolved.\n    The only countries which make the supercomputer are the\nUnited States and Japan.\n    In New Delhi, Indian officials told Reuters that a U.S.\noffer had been made.\n    \"An announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time,\"\nan official said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nigeria and France have signed a\nbilateral agreement to reschedule Nigeria's\nofficial debt to France, government sources said.\n    The accord was signed here yesterday by Nigerian Finance\nMinister Chu Okongwu and senior French Treasury officials after\ntalks with CoFACE, the French export credit agency, they said.\n    The agreement came after a similar agreement with Britain\nthis week and follows an accord between Nigeria and the Paris\nClub of western creditor governments in December to reschedule\nsome 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.\n    The Paris Club multilateral agreement concerned medium and\nlong-term debt due between September 1986 and end-1987 over 10\nyears with five years grace.\n    As with all Paris Club rescheduling accords, specific\ninterest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a\nbilateral basis with the creditor countries involved. No\ndetails of the discussions here were immediately available.\n    The agreement signed on Tuesday with Britain's Export\nCredits Guarantee Department was the first in Nigeria's tour of\ncreditor nations. Okongwu left Paris today for London and is\ndue back in Nigeria on Monday, diplomatic sources said.\n    Nigeria is hoping that further bilateral accords can be\nconcluded soon as this could encourage official export credit\nagencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria.\n    CoFACE suspended its cover for medium and long-term export\ncontracts with Nigeria in 1983, but maintained its cover for\ncurrent trade deals involving consumer goods with six-month\ncredit periods, CoFACE sources said.\n    \"We have an open position regarding Nigeria,\" the sources\nsaid, adding that it was for French Finance Minister Edouard\nBalladur to decide whether to renew full insurance cover.\n    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export\ncredits this year from official agencies under a structural\nadjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to\nreschedule part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    But these credits cannot be approved until the export\ncredit agencies agree to resume insuring the credits.\n    French exports to Nigeria were 3.42 billion francs in 1986,\ndown from 4.94 billion in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to\nFrance were 5.63 billion francs in 1986, down from 15.33\nbillion in 1985. Details of Nigeria's official debts to France\nwere not immediately available.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

GNP includes such\npayments or outflows.\n    The bank also said there were indications the country's\neconomic recovery was becoming more broadly based.\n    With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the\neconomy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic\nproduction.\n    The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were\nrecorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.\nReserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.\n    Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70\nbillion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total\nannual value of import payments.\n    The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand\nin 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.\n    The bank said continuing strength of the current account\nhas allowed foreign reserves to be \"rebuilt to more comfortable\nlevels.\"\n    \"This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending\nsupport to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to\nbe called for,\" the bank said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. cotton farmers are likely to\nplant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an\naverage of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing\nup for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting\nintentions report next Tuesday.\n    The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse\nof what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which\nbegins August 1.\n    Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to\n10.9 mln acres.\n    On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton\nfarmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.\n    Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres\nhad been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986\nplanted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\n    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\n1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good\ndemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\nsaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\n    \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\ngoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\nSoybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\nInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\nmarket specialists.\n    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\nincreased acreage, analysts said.\n    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\nwho used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\nwere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\ngovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\nwill not pick up the tab for storage.\n    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\nparticipating in the program, which could result in more\ncotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\n25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\nShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\nparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \nthey have.\n    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\nWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of the\nprogram. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\none commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\non forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\nannual meeting in late January.\n    But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\ndecided they should be in the program for security reasons.\nThere's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the\ngovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\nprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\nBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\n    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\nincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting\nintentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\nbased on information they gathered before their cotton program\nwas announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\ntraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output\nwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.\n    Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think\nplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\nrate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\nharvested.\n    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\nat 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\nstates. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The price of gold bullion and share\nprices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from\ncontinued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.\n    \"There's been a tug of war between the (currency)\nspeculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it\nlooks like the game has gone to the speculators,\" said John Ing\nat Maison Placements Canada Inc.\n    The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today\nagainst the Japanese yen despite buying by several central\nbanks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.\n    A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the\ntraditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.\n    Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,\nnoted that \"a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.\nIf they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.\"\n    A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing\nsaid, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a\nfour pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.\n    Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its\ncurrent level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an\naverage price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael\nPickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,\nwith a possible spike above 500 dlrs.\n    However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far\nfaster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,\ncausing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere\nin the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign\nthe buying pressure is slowing down. \"The stocks have run an\nincredible way,\" Cohen said.\n    On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd <ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,\nCampbell Red Lake Mines <CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold\n<NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.\n    The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268\npoints at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC\nMinerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at\n43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.\n    Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct\nsince December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has\nincreased six pct. \"Canadian golds have been the top performing\nindex this year,\" he noted.\n    In the U.S., there is \"too much money chasing too few\nstocks,\" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as\npension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,\nhe added.\n    Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through\nsix dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the\nprecious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold\nand silver prices to narrow.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Energy prices,\nwhich fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a\nmore moderate 1.9 pct last month.\n    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations\nand had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.\n    Among the key components of the report, transportation\nprices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain\nreflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and\ndeclines in new car prices and finance charges.\n    \"There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,\"\nsaid William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n    Economists said the latest CPI supports existing\nexpectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.\n    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.\nWithout last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.\n    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a\nresult of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy\ncomponent warrant attention in case gains in these areas become\nfactored into the wider economic picture.\n    \"As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in\ncost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus\nreducing international competitiveness, then the Federal\nReserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct\ninflation,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

The stock fell 2.75 dlrs a share to clsoe at 61.75\ndlrs.\n    TPA stands for tissue plasminogen activator, and would be\nused on heart attack victims to clear blockage in a vein or\nartery. Though other blood clot dissolvers are on the market,\nTPA is said to be more effective and with fewer side effects.\n    Analysts have projected the worldwide market for the drug\nat as high as 1.5 billion dlrs a year.\n    Stuart Weisbrod, a biotechnology analyst with Prudential\nBache Securities Inc., told Reuters the additional FDA review\nlikely would keep TPA off the market until at least November.\n    Approval had been expected this spring.\n    He said the FDA action prompted him to cut his estimate of\nGenentech's 1987 earnings to about 40 cents a share from his\nearlier projection of 67 cents a share.\n    He said the delay would lower Genentech's 1987 revenues\nfrom TPA to about five to six mln dlrs compared to an earlier\nprojection of 50 to 60 mln dlrs of 1987 revenues.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said, however, that\nlarger acquisitions are possible if they are the right fit.\n    Danforth, who earlier today said he expects earnings growth\nin the double-digit range through 1989, said he is comfortable\nwith analysts' predictions of 4.80 dlrs to 5.30 dlrs a share\nthis year. In 1986 the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share.\n    He said the company has targeted waste energy systems and\nhazardous waste removal, as some of the emerging growth areas\nfor the company.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Some of the crop is far enough along\nso that it's probably vulnerable,\" Krenzler said.\n    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving\nfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's\nfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a\nlow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the\nsystem.\n    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit\nOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures\ncould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.\n    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop\nhas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more\nvulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.\n    \"We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26\ndegrees (fahrenheit),\" Krenzler said, \"as long as we don't have\na lot of wind.\"\n    \"If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we\nhave a good chance of significant damage to the heads,\" he\nsaid.\n    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and\nsouthwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.\nCrops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed\nand have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Inc -- have agreed in principle to dispose\nof substantially all their remaining operating shipping assets.\n    The units have been operating under protection of Chapter\n11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.\n    McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX\nCorp's <CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its\nTranspacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.\n    McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln\ndlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various\nother equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and\ntheree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two\nMcLean subsidiaries.\n    As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer\nits South American Service to <Crowley Maritime Corp>'s\nAmerican Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed\nlease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a\nparticipation based on American Transport's South American\nrevenues.\n    McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release\nU.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for\nthree vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have\nbeen returned to Crowley.\n    McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln\ndlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four\nyears at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.)\nsubsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American\nTransport.\n    The company said both agreements in principle have been\napproved by directors of the companies involved, but still need\ncourt, regulatory and lender approval.\n    McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to\nschedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements,\nadding that the court has granted the company's request to\nextend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to\nfile a proposed plan of reorganization.\n    It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no\nsignificant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels,\nwhich are not in operation and are expected to be sold.\n    McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels\noperating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit\nthe planned transfer to purchasers.\n    The company said U.S. Lines will maintain its weekly\nservice from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and Guam until the\nvessels are transferred and the transaction is completed.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)\nhas proposed stringent limits on the portion of futures trading\nthat can be conducted between \"trading rings,\" or  affiliated\ngroups of floor brokers, according to a CME spokesman.\n    Violators would be subject to fines of as much as 50,000\ndlrs, the exchange said in a letter distributed to its members\nearlier this week.\n    The proposal is one of the reforms the exchange's Board of\nGovernors suggested to curb practices that have come under fire\nfor unfairly limiting competition on the floor. Local traders\nclaim that trading among broker \"rings\" violates the\nopen-outcry system prevailing in the futures markets.\n    Limits on ring trading would be applied floor-wide under\nthe proposal. The other reforms, which address dual trading,\nwould apply only to the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index\nfutures pit.\n    A debate over dual trading, the practice of trading for\none's own account and filling customer orders, has arisen\nbecause many traders believe it can create a climate for\ntrading abuses, especially in the extremely volatile stock\nindex futures pit.\n    Adoption of the Board of Governors' reforms hinges on an\nApril 13 vote of CME members on a membership petition, signed\nby several hundred members in February, that would bar all dual\ntrading at the exchange.\n    Defeat of the petition is likely, according to a floor\nbroker contacted by Reuters, who also said he welcomed the\nlimits on the \"ring\" traders. If members reject the petition,\nthat would open up the way for the Board of Governors' reforms.\n    CME President William Brodsky said the need to curb broker\ngroup trading has grown \"as the groups have gotten larger.\" \"A\nlot of the individuals were losing business because they were\nfaced with a large-scale competition. The Board began studying\nthe problem about six months ago.\n    Under the proposed reforms, members of a broker rings --\ndefined as brokers who share brokerage fees, revenues,\nexpenses, a deck of customer orders or employee salary expenses\n-- would be barred from trading more than 15 pct of their\npersonal trades with each other. Those found in violation would\nbe subject to fines of up to 50,000 dlrs.\n    Broker ring members would also be prohibited from trading\nmore than 25 pct of customer orders with each other. Fines of\nup to 10,000 dlrs would be levied on violators.\n    More stringent limits were proposed on individual trading\nthan customer orders because \"we don't want to negatively\nimpact customer orders,\" Brodsky said. \"On the other hand, the\nneed to do a personal order is very different.\"\n    Broker associations would also be limited to having no more\nthan one member serving on an exchange disciplinary or pit\ncommittee.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The London Metal Exchange's, LME,\ndecision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,\nwith the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a\npositive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.\n    Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum\npurity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,\n1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct\ncontract.\n    This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European\ndelivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at\nSingapore as a delivery point for other contracts.\n    Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with\nexisting industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt\nmaterial, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.\n    The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive\nmove by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and\nJapanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to\nwarrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.\n    Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler\nwith a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost\nexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be\ndone during the sterling rings, they added.\n    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more\nclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the\nrecent wide backwardations.\n    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct\npurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc\ncountries, such as Romania.\n    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined\nas an exporter recently, they said.\n    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from\nliquidity problems initially, as business may continue to\ncentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where\nthere are many holders of large short positions on the LME.\n    But others said the new contract would soon attract trading\ninterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been\nattracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.\n    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a\nnew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where\nhigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they\nsaid.\n    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will\neventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like\nstandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,\ngob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process\nin this case may take longer, they added.\n    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore\nwarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,\nwhich make physical trading difficult, would not totally\ndisappear as a result, the trade sources said.\n    These premiums for prompt metal have become a\nsemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased\nbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presently\naround 50 stg.\n    Increasingly large granting of option positions has been\ntaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at\nthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes\naround these dates are commonplace, they said.\n    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern\noperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of\nhaving to cover.\n    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even\nthough the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the\ndeclaration and prompt dates.\n    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the\nmonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.\n    Backwardations will remain while operators continue to\ngrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds\naluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Hutton food analyst June Page said.\n    The food group, whose stocks have underperformed since the\nbeginning of the year after about five years of growth, seems\nto have turned around, DLJ Securities analyst William Leach\nagreed.\n    The fundamentals remain favorable and may even be enhanced\nby the effects of tax reform for companies such as Sara Lee\nCorp <SLE>, Quaker Oats Co <OAT>, and General Mills Inc <GIS>,\nPage said. These and other food companies are recommended as\naggressive buys on a selective basis by most brokerage houses\nsurveyed.\n    The current economy provides an environment of stable\ninflation, interest rates and energy costs, which gives food\ncompanies the flexibility to expand profit margins over a\nperiod of time, Page said. Lower commodity costs allow for\nfurther price flexibility, she added.\n    Another plus is that increases in labor and packaging in\nthe food industry have been minimal, she noted.\n    For 1987, Page said E.F. Hutton sees inflation holding\nunder four pct, oil prices stabilizing at 17 to 18 dlrs a\nbarrel and interest rates remaining at current levels.\n    As a result of new production facilities featuring\nsophisticated technology \"companies now have a lower breakeven\npoint because they have enhanced productivity and lower\noverhead costs,\" she said.\n    Unit volume growth has accelerated in the past several\nyears in the food industry due to product segmentation, that\nis, iintends to\nfile for an offering of about two mln shares within the next 30\ndays.\n    It said proceeds would be used for working capital and\nother general corporate purposes, including the possible\nacquisition of other businesses or additional technology.\n    Ashton-Tate now has about 23.6 mln shares outstanding.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\ncontrols would be used during emergency.\n    Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade\nsurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion\nin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade\nwith the United States, according to official figures.\n    But he said that while easing the controls would help\nreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a\nshort time.\n    Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from\ngrowing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest\ntrading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.\n    Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told\nReuters: \"The decision came a little bit late. But it was better\nthan never.\"\n    Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said\nthe government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange\ncontrols and open its market wider to help balance trade with\nits trading partners, especially the United States.\n    \"The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange\ncontrols will not only help our trading partners, but also help\nour own economic problems,\" he said.\n    He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost\nTaiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Its\norders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.\nSpace shuttle disaster in January 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar\nwas likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an\nimprovement in the huge American trade deficit would be only\ntemporary at current world exchange rate levels.\n    Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty\nTrust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the\nsteady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to\nrein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.\n    Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab\nCambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last\nmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollar\naround current levels left many questions unanswered.\n    \"I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the\ndollar,\" Viermetz said. \"I believe there is room for a further\nfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.\"\n    The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great\nBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February\nto stabilise major currencies around current levels.\n    The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,\nwith Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the\ndollar lower had made life impossible for West German and\nJapanese exporters.\n    The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued\nslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in\nSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the\nvalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.\n    But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed\nthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued\nsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade\ndeficit would improve only temporarily.\n    He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this\nyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120\nbillion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160\nbillion dlrs.\n    \"This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities\nand politicians in Washington,\" he said.\n    Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should\nattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck\nwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.\n    Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or\n\"Plaza Accord,\" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240\nyen.\n    Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to\nsee the dollar hold within a \"loose range\" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks\nand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency\nlower being countered by central bank intervention.\n    The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --\nits lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40\nyears. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\nAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\nmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\ninvestment banking.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded\na conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the\nUnited States over trade in computer microchips.\n    \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by\nexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that\nneed to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as\nsaying.\n    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose\ntariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said\nTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington\nto help settle the dispute.\n    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request\nnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides would\nprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17\ndeadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.\n    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan\ninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies are\ndumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.\n    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300\nmln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic\ngoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to\nlive up to their bilateral chip pact.\n    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months of\nheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price\nchips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.\n    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory\nthan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,\nwho earlier today said Japan was ready to take \"appropriate\nmeasures\" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.\n    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)\nofficials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's\nremark and said that his main message was that the two sides\nneed to talk urgently about the issue.\n    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the\nUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based international\norganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposed\nthe tariffs.\n    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article\n23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they\nsaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panel\nto consider the legality of the U.S. Action.\n    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. \"It\nmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United\nStates may lift its decision at an early date,\" Tamura said.\n    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, President\nRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had\nevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world\nmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports.\n    Japanese government officials said they are confident they\ncan make the pact work.\n    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips\nthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up after\nMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.\n    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese\nimports of American chips, MITI officials said that the\nministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.\n    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,\nsome of whom are also leading producers, to step up their\npurchases of foreign semiconductors.\n    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T>\nsaid his firm would do just that and could announce its plans\nin the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies to\ndo likewise.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Turkey\"s standoff with Greece over Aegean\noil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had\nbeen assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed\nwaters.\n    A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was\nclaiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North\nAegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for\noil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said.\n    \"In the same way it has been understood that Greece will\nalso not undertake oil activities outside its territorial\nwaters,\" the statement added.\n    An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign\nMinister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in\ndialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the\ndispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.\n    \"We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us\n- let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,\"\nhe said.\n    The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a\nnumber of the country\"s political parties on the latest\ndevelopments.\n    Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean\nyesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having\nearlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the\nvessel would stay in Turkish areas.\n    Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after\nheart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an\necstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.\n    He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio:\n\"We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the\nAnatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they\nare for mankind.\"\n    Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials\nacknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the\ncontinental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.\n    Turkey alleged that the consortium\"s plans would have\ninfringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries,\nwhich called for a moratorium on any activities until the\ndelimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it\nconsiders the accord inoperative.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Greece declined\ncomment on the statement.\n    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the\nlong-standing continental shelf dispute to the International\nCourt of Justice at The Hague.\n    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said\nhe had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General\nSecretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Emirates Industrial Bank has\npredicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states\nfollowing higher oil revenues.\n    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said\ntotal oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\ncountries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from\n33.5 billion in 1986.\n    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia\nand the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil\nprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain\noverall group production.\n    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight\ndollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.\n    \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in\nthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected\ngrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\"\nthe study said.\n    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher\nbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from past\nrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.\n    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise\nto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.\n    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined\ntrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in\n1985.\n    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product\nto 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

There is quite a substantial way to go\nyet.\"\n    He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a\nplausible project.\n    The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi\nArabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab\nEmirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to\nexamine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system\nwhich bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary\nSystem (EMS).\n    At present, five currencies are linked either officially or\nin practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is\npegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.\n    A common currency system or EMS-style \"grid\" would, in\ntheory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable\nexchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a\nvery low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain\nsmall. \"Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their\ninfancy,\" he said.\n    Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a\npaucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that\noften does not recognise the western banking concept of\ninterest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Expects more harmonious\ntalks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's\nfirst official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes\nbetween the two countries begin to fade.\n    \"The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war\ndidn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation\non terrorism,\" one U.S. Official told Reuters.\n    \"It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,\nmore harmonious than usual.\"\n    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to\ndeal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the\nUnited States.\n    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in\nLibya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.\nPlanes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a\ncircuitous route. That angered Washington.\n    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a\nyear ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong\nenough action against terrorism. \"Now they are. We're pleased\nand they are pleased that we are pleased,\" one said.\n    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain\nmarkets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European\nCommunity  threatened to become a trade war.\n    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate\nCommunity moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was\npoised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food\nimports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.\n    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,\nsupported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a\nmajor success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases\nin northern Chad.\n    A French official added: \"There is also a common interest in\ngetting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the\nworld by opening up its markets.\"\n    Although relations have improved markedly between the two\ncountries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the\nCommunity's common agricultural policy (CAP).\n    To Washington, as one official put it, \"CAP is the root of\nall evil\" in international food trade because it subsidises\nfarmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world\nprices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But\nthey became a serious topic for America and the West only after\nthe failure of the Iranian invasion plan (against the south\nIraqi city of Basra) and as a balloon to cover up the Irangate\nstory,\" Aziz said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct\nof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for\n14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.\n    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01\npct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9\npct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and\nfive pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked\nto AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.\n    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer\nagreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Disbursements of loans,\nincluding previously-approved loans, fell to 557.2 mln dinars\nfrom 783.9 mln.\n    The Bank in 1986 decided to establish a fund under the name\n\"IDB Unit Trust\" to introduce and market financial instruments in\nline with the principles of Islam, the report said.\n    \"This experience will provide a foundation for the floating\nof other financial instruments in the near future through which\nthe bank expects to mobilise even larger resources,\" the report\nsaid.\n    The IDB was established by the 46-member Islamic Conference\nOrganisation and opened in October 1975.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But the Plaza accord\ndid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.\n    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that\nthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Voters simply dropped the official\nballot paper with the single candidate's name into an urn.\n    Tass said districts chosen for the experiment would return\nseveral deputies rather than a single representative to local\ncouncil bodies.\n    The announcement followed pledges on electoral reform by\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, campaigning to revitalise\nconfidence in the communist system after what he has described\nas a period of stagnation.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Some postal charges will\ngo up 100 pct next month and rail and bus fares by 30 pct in\nOctober.\n    The government said its annual plan for the economy had\nspecified a 13 pct increase in food prices this year.\n    \"Economic reasoning calls for greater price rises than those\nwhich have been announced ... The government has taken an\neconomic risk in accepting a portion of the trades unions'\ndemands,\" the communique said.\n    The National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ), which claims\nseven million members, warned earlier this month it would fight\nefforts to impose the original range of price rises. It said\nthe rises would badly affect the lower paid and the old,\ndespite government pledges to protect their purchasing power.\n    Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, whose banned organisation\nhas been replaced by the OPZZ, condemned the increases in front\nof a crowd of 1,500 cheering supporters at St Brygida's Roman\nCatholic Church in the Baltic port of Gdansk.\n    \"For the first time in six years (since Solidarity was\nbanned), I say enough. For the first time, I am decidedly\nagainst. I am against price rises as being the only sign of\nreform,\" Walesa said.\n    \"I am for reforms.

GenCorp has said a statement would be made on or before\nthe company's annual meeting on Tuesday.\n    General Acquisition said the board could not carry out its\nduties to shareholders and make an informed decision until it\nhas, \"... Explored with us the ways in which our offer can be\nrevised to provide greater value to your shareholders.\"\n    General Acquisition added it was aware the board may be\nreviewing alternative transactions, which might provide GenCorp\nshareholders with a payment other than cash.\n    \"If that is the case, you should recognise that our\nadditional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash\nand securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide\nin any similarly structured transaction,\" it said.\n    It added GenCorp's board had an obligation to present any\nalternative proposal to shareholders in a way that allowed\ncompeting offers.\n    General Acquisition requested it be given a chance to bid\non a competitive and fair basis before any final decision was\nmade on any other buyout proposal.\n    The statement repeated the request GenCorp remove a \"poison\npill\" preferred share purchase rights to shareholders, making\nany takeover more expensive.\n    It said it might take legal action, or seek the support of\nshareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board\nand consider other proposals.\n    GenCorp should not accept any other proposal containing\ndefensive features, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Finance Ministry is trying to\neliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of\nJapanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central\nbanks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a\nsenior Finance Ministry official said.\n    The official declined to give details but securities\nsources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills\nto be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy\nbills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is\ntime consuming, they said.\n    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling\nsix-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas\ngovernments and central banks because of the tax system and the\nBank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts\nbe kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.\n    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a\nkey short-term instrument to promote internationalization of\nthe yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry\nsystem for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments\nand central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the\nsources said.\n    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore\nexpected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of\nJapan, the securities sources said.\n    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next\nU.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of\nTokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan is becoming dangerously isolated\nagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by\nJapanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,\nofficials and businessmen from around the world said.\n    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,\nmaking Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments\ngrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said\nthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.\n    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by\nboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.\n    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of\nJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction\ndue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\ntransformation in its traditional policies on economic\nmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\ndevelopment for Japan without this transformation.\"\n    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\nlooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\nJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\nprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\nprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\nraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\nthe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\nsemiconductor pact.\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\nblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\nplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\nby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\ntelecommunications joint venture.\n    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\nbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\nleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\n    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\nKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\nviews last November when he visited the European Community.\n\"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\nfound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\nwas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\nresults of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n    \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\naway from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\ndomestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\n    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\nPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\nonly know that your government, under the leadership of\nMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\noutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,\nunderlined by von Moltke's reference to the \"leadership\" of the\nMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\nSeptember's government programme of new economic measures.\n\"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\nthat the government has put its signature to a programme\ndesigned to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Japanese government appears to have\nlittle new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over\ncomputer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.\n    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300\nmln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In\nretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the\nmicrochip trade signed last September.\n    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has done\nwhat it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait\nfor those steps to take effect.\"\n    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September\nagreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in\nnon-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.\nChip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.\n     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut\nproduction in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in\nthird countries at non-regulated prices.\n    \"I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said\nJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.\n    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call\nfor production cuts beyond those already sought, although it\nwould continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.\n    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they\nwould consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita\nElectric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in\nimports was not likely.\n    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if\nthe United States did implement the tariffs, which would be\nlevied on consumer electronics products rather than on\nmicrochips themselves.\n    \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,\nthere will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\"\nsaid Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.\n    \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be\nstopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be\ndelayed for another year,\" he said.\n    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by\nstepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan\nfor semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.\n    \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine\nFleming's Edwards said.\n    \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they\nwant to do is hit the makers of the final products because that\nhurts the final market,\" Edwards said.\n    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.\nConcern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also\nfrustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts\nargued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have\nto take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.\n    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,\nsaid \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic\neconomy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to\nstabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to\ninfluence currency trading, dealers said.\n    After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen\nfrom an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish\nof 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,\nthey said.\n    \"I think (Nakasone's) desperate,\" said a U.S. Bank foreign\nexchange manager.\n    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament\nthat Japan and other industrialized nations committed\nthemselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above\n150 yen.\n    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee\nthat the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And\nWest Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar\nfell below 150 yen.\n    \"His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should\nhave had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150\nyen,\" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.\n    Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and\nis likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145\nyen.\n    Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.\nAnd Japan will continue to depress the dollar.\n    The trade issue has now become a political issue since the\nReagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over\nth3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade\ndeficit, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japanese securities houses and banks\nare eager to enter the market for lead-management of mark\neurobonds when the ban on Japanese institutions is lifted, but\nthe entry may be difficult, Japanese bankers said.\n    Most Japanese securities houses and banks established here\nsaid they have concrete plans to enter lead-management\nbusiness, as soon as terms are cleared, probably this year.\n    Japan's largest bank, The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, is also\nconsidering expanding its business here, bankers said.\n    Japanese banks were excluded from lead management of mark\neurobonds when the Bundesbank opened that market to foreign\nbanks in May 1985, due to the lack of reciprocity for German\nbanks in the Japanese market.\n    Last year, the Japanese began a slow opening by granting\nWest German banks investment licences.\n    Pressure on Tokyo stepped up last week when U.K. Government\nsources said Britain may revoke the licences of some Japanese\nbanks and securities firms operating in London when they come\nup for renewal if progress is not made towards opening Japan's\nmarkets to foreign competition.\n    A spokesman for the Dai-Ichi Kangyo representative office\nhere said the bank was naturally considering options such as\nexpanding its mark securities trading operations to Frankfurt.\n    Sources at the bank's London branch said the bank was\nalready seriously planning such a move.\n    Expanding secondary operations would also improve the\nplacement capacity of Japanese houses intending to move into\nlead management of mark eurobonds.\n    But even Japanese banks already established in secondary\nmarkets here face a host of problems in lead management. One is\nfinding borrowers.\n    One banker at Nikko Securities Co Ltd's The Nikko\nSecurities Co (Deutschland) GmbH said the cost of mark issues\nmay be too high for some Japanese firms.\n    \"For the moment, for Japanese borrowers, marks are\nexpensive,\" he said. Many prefer Swiss francs or eurodollars.\n    A Japanese borrower with a five-year equity warrant\neurodollar bond issued at 2-1/2 pct can now swap into domestic\nyen rates of one pct. But mark swap opportunities are limited.\n    In addition, many Japanese companies are committed already\nto large German banks.\n    To avoid souring relations with German banks they now\ncooperate with, Japanese houses may prefer finding borrowers so\nfar not seen in the mark sector.\n    Names may include Sanyo Electric Co Ltd and Nishimatsu\nConstruction Co Ltd, which both count Yamaichi Securities Co\nLtd as their house bank, or Hokkaido Electric Power Co Inc,\nwhich recently gave a presentation here with the Industrial\nBank of Japan's unit here.\n    Japanese banks are also faced with finding local personnel,\nwhich is not easy. \"They are definitely going to have a manpower\nproblem,\" one Swiss banker said.\n    Swiss and American banks had no trouble attracting top\nGerman managers. But Japanese cultural differences will be\nharder for Germans to overcome. Success may depend on whether\nJapanese parents allow German subsidiaries independence to\noperate without interference.\n    Once established, more problems are expected if extra\ncompetition shaves margins.\n    Extra competition could cut management fees in the mark\nsector. Separate management and underwriting fees common here\nmay also be eroded, which now make German underwriting business\nprofitable compared with other centres.\n    A few banks are unsure if they really want to get involved\nin the business. \"I don't think Sumitomo has 100-pct concrete\nplans at this moment unless there is a new development,\" a\nbanker at the West German commercial branch of Sumito Bank Ltd\nin Duesseldorf said.\n    Apart from the commercial branch in Duesseldorf Sumitomo\nhas a rep office in Frankfurt, but both are primarily engaged\nin commercial banking. If Sumitomo were to set up a securities\noperation, it would have to set up a full subsidiary, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Orders in\nhand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.\n    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax\nprofit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.\n    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year\nalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and\nforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.\n    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on\nstocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In\nthe parent company, the positive earnings development\ncontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to\n1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was\nbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in\nraw materials. \n    In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47\nbillion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell\n8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.\n    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine\nchemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in\nthose areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.\n    Results from these had been taken only partly into the\nfourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.\n    So far in the current year, the investment volume of the\nparent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,\nBASF said, without giving concrete figures.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bahrain is introducing a new domestic\nmoney market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on\nthe island's newly launched treasury bill programme.\n    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all\ncommercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which\ngives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in\ntreasury bills, or through discounting them.\n    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current\narrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be\nvalid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\"\n    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's\n20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term\nswaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term\nloans secured against government development bonds.\n    \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace\nthese operations with short-term assistance based on Government\nof Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states.\n    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a\nsimultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a\nhigher price which will reflect an interest charge.\n    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will\nnormally be for a period of seven days.\n    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of\n91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since\nraised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.\n    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have\nbeen making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered\nby the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from\nApril 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury\nbills in case they need funds from the central bank.\n    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold\ntreasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper\ncould increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted\nyields slightly.\n    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had\nstarted at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.\n    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through\nrepurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar\nswaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would\nforesake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying\ntreasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But it said it would be a great deal to expect of a\ngovernment in what was probably an election year.\n    It said even a relatively minor cut in the deficit would\nrequire some unpleasant decisions, noting a repeat of the\n1986/87 budget's zero real growth in spending would only bring\nthe deficit to about 4.3 billion dlrs.\n    A cut of greater than two pct in real terms was needed if a\n2.5 billion dlr deficit was to be achieved and this required\nsome radical surgery to existing programs, the bank said.\n    Westpac said the government's mid-May mini-budget provided\nan opportunity for bold measures, both in relation to the size\nof the government's role in the economy and the principles\ngoverning that activity, notably indexation of outlays.\n    It said official figures show 93 pct of outlays in some way\nindexed, hard to justify when living standards outside the\npublic sector were being eroded.\n    In current circumstances, the alternative to fiscal\ndiscipline is the sure road to bigger external debts, further\ncurrency depreciation, a boost to inflation and, ultimately,\ncapital flight, the bank said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

There has been a\nlot of talking and loud thinking.\"\n    Business leaders said the 17-year rescheduling of\ncommercial bank debt would give President Corazon Aquino some\nbadly-needed breathing space, but warned her government was\nstill in the midst of political consolidation.\n    \"There is a lot of interest among foreign investors in the\ncountry, but now they are waiting to see what happens in the\ncongressional and local elections later this year,\" said\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce president George Drysdale.\n    The government is serious about getting down to work, but\nthere are many individual agendas for growth and no consensus.\nBut each step brings a unanimity of opinion closer, he said.\n    Aurelio Periquet, President of the Philippine Chamber of\nCommerce and Industry, told Reuters the debt accord had\npositively translated the international banking community's\nconfidence in the country's economy and Aquino's government.\n    \"This government needs less pressure and more time and\nhappily our creditors seem to see it that way,\" he said. \"This\naccord may not result in an immediate boom, but at least it\nenhances the image of the country for foreign investors.\"\n    But Periquet said domestic and foreign investments fell\nshort of targets in 1986. \"The accord does not solve all our\nproblems,\" he added.\n    Periquet said the question of political stability no longer\nworried Filipino businessmen, who had already started expanding\nexisting businesses or investing in new areas.\n    \"A number of us have already put in new money and there are\nplans for the export market,\" he said. \"President Aquino has\nshown her ability to pull the nation out of one crisis after\nanother.\"\n    Roeher said foreign investment would probably be held back\nuntil after the congressional polls in May and the local\nelections in August. \"The two elections will probably have a\nmore decisive effect on the way business reacts,\" he said.\n    \"Some foreign companies are not waiting, but they are more\nthe exception than the rule,\" Roeher said.\n    He said it was important the government ensure the creation\nof more jobs was not just a transitory development.\n    \"The absorption of enormous aid given to the Philippines is\nalso poor. A lot of it has not been put to use. The government\nshould act without further delay to absorb the 1.7 billion dlrs\nof development aid it will receive in 1987,\" he said.\n    A foreign banker close to the debt negotiations said he did\nnot foresee any real boom until 1989.\n    \"The problem is that Aquino has inherited her political\nsystem from (former President Ferdinand) Marcos,\" the banker\nsaid. \"There is still a clamour for the sharing of benefits,\ndifferent sectors claiming their rights and duties. If they go\ntoo fast there could be another bust two years down the road.\"\n    Businessman Raul Concepcion, whose brother Jose is the\ncountry's trade and industry minister, said everyone could\nheave a sigh of relief. \"Now that the debt agreement is out of\nthe way, our economic and financial officials can concentrate\non their work, like increasing government revenue and\nefficiency,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that\nare more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease\ncorynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research\nInstitute told Reuters.\n    Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old\nwould undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as\npossible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the\ntree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees\nmature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per\nhectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.\n    About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC\n103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.\n    Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which\ncauses leaves to fall off, De Mel said.\n    Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.\n    De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early\nas in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986\nthat it became widespread.\n    The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many\ntrees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be\nsprayed and remain under observation.\n    T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller\nDepartment, which monitors the industry, told Reuters\nreplanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before\nlate May when the monsoon rains begin.\n    De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible\nto corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC\n106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.\n    The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign\nclones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN\n2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.\n    Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by\nPB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.\n    These six varieties would also be used to replace trees\nuprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.\n    Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per\nhectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.\n    \"But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,\" he\nadded.\n    De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the\nspread of the disease.\n    \"The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably\nhelped in some way because trees have not been affected in\nareas that are dry,\" he said.\n    Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it\nhas not caused a drop in production.\n    Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last\nweek firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at the\nprevious sale.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said\nPhilippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercial\nbank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt\nrescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.\n    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial\ninstruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion\ninto pesos to fund government-approved equity investments\nwithin the Philippines.\n    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the\ngovernment was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs\nworth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.\n    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\n18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at the\nidea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had called\nfor substantial new commercial bank lending and development\nbank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their\neconomic troubles.\n    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed\nby these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome\nforeign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a\nbusinessmen's meeting. \"And this can now be achieved without\nforcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending.\"\n    Bankers in New York said given the booming market in\ndebt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the\nnotes at an appropriate discount.\n    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated\nsavings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year\nlife.\n    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously\nrescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between\nJanuary 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money\nlent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points\nover London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).\n    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.\n    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was\nbetter than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs\nproposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and\ngenerate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic\nenterprises.\n    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as\nwell as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western\ncreditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the\ncountry's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its\ncurrent level of 40 to 45 pct.\n    He said the country's balance of payments was now projected\nat a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a\nsurplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous\nprojected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.\n    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three\ntimes before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin\nsaid. \"What we have now is PINs IV,\" he said.\n    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain\nterms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won\na 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.\n    \"And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money\ncross the table even as of today,\" Ongpin said, adding he\nexpected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483\ncreditor banks worldwide.\n    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with\nPresident Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to\ntake a very tough stance on pricing.\n    \"But the President's instructions were unequivocal and\nunwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care\nhow long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don't\ncome home without a deal we can all be proud of',\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Call money was still\nat or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recent\nBundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.\n    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billion\nmarks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset by\nan estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasury\nbills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said. \n    Rates could ease later in the week as bank customers\ndeposit part of their pension payments back with the banks\ntomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements for\na new month, dealers said.\n    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to\n43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion on\nWednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 days\nof the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above the\nrequired daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    \nThe Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchase\ntender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. \ndealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of new\nrepo funding.\n    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-term\ntemporary federal government funds to counteract this. The last\nsuch liquidity injection was carried out as call money rates\nrose above 4.00 pct earlier this month, dealers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It reported\nthat pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from\n21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after\n252.2 mln.\n    The strong recovery of the first six months continued into\nthe second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only\nmodestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher\nvolumes.\n    The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the\npricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition\ndue to growing imports and the possibility that the system\nwould be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.\nGovernment. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from\nstrong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation\nhad a difficult period with high maintenance costs and\nincreased depreciation charges.\n    The company is proposing to change its name at the next\nannual meeting to <Rugby Group Plc>.\n    Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It\nnoted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to\nsell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some\nseven mln stg above end-1986 book value.\n    The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby\nshares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Friday's close.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> said it has\nreached a series of agreements giving it an indirect majority\nstake in the <Fichtel und Sachs AG> car parts group.\n    The takeover is contingent on approval from the Federal\nCartel Office in West Berlin, a spokesman said, adding that\nMannesmann was confident the authorities would not block the\npurchase.\n    Mannesmann is buying 75 pct of <MEC Sachs\nVermoegensholding> which owns 37.5 pct of Sachs AG, which in\nturn holds 96.5 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. The MEC shares will\nbe bought from the granddaughters of the firm's founder.\n    Mannesmann is also purchasing a 25.01 pct stake in Fichtel\nund Sachs from Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> and has an option to buy\nthe bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.\n    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also\ntalking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG\n <SALG.H> on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs.\n This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.\n    Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original\nplans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks\nwith the government in Bonn.\n    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want\na majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was\nseeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which\nhas annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.\n    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to\ndiversify into high-technology areas and away from its previous\nreliance on steel and pipe-making. More\n    A spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office later said\nthe anti-cartel authorities would probably rule on the takeover\nin the new few weeks.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

However, the group\nwould not seek a listing for the time being.\n    B and C also said that its chairman, Lord Cayzer, planned\nto retire in June.

        "body": "The buffer stock rules agreement reached\non Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an\nimprovement on previous arrangements but the price-support\nmechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa\nprices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.\n    The accord was reached between producers and consumers of\nthe 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.\n    European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the\naccord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses\noverhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.\n    \"If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it\nwill do anything more than stop the price from falling further,\nand it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate\nprices,\" a European dealer said.\n    And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,\nor is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market\nis relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could\npressure prices dramatically, dealers said.\n    The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,\ninto which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to\nmanoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.\n    A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but\ndelegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.\n    The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock\nmanager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three\nweeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing\ncountries and assessing the market, since prices are below the\n\"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne\nspecified in the agreement, the sources said.\n    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum\n100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will\nbe more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.\n    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a\nbuying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of\nwhich are already in the buffer stock.\n    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister\nDenis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of\nstabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa\nproducer.\n    \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw\nimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon\ntold reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned\nthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000\ntonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.\n    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from\nthe final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the\npact.\n    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most\nexpensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,\nmade a formal protest to the council about the price\ndifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high\nfor Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.\n    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West\nGermany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer\nstock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There\nwere no real winners or losers.\"\n    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that\nimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and as\na result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as\neffectively as they could have, delegates said.\n    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek\noffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to\nreflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise\nup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.\n    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per\ntonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg\nin January 1986.\n    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000\ntonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session\ndecides market conditions warrant it, according to the\nagreement.\n    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall\nbelow the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five\ndays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has\nbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.\n    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an\nexecutive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Finance Ministry is trying to\neliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of\nJapanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central\nbanks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a\nsenior Finance Ministry official said.\n    The official declined to give details but securities\nsources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills\nto be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy\nbills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is\ntime consuming, they said.\n    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling\nsix-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas\ngovernments and central banks because of the tax system and the\nBank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts\nbe kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.\n    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a\nkey short-term instrument to promote internationalization of\nthe yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry\nsystem for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments\nand central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the\nsources said.\n    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore\nexpected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of\nJapan, the securities sources said.\n    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next\nU.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of\nTokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The proportion of earnings gleaned from commission\nbusiness should be higher, while the role played by the more\ntraditional credit lending business would show further erosion.\n    Stock exchange volumes remained high last year, depite only\nmodest share index rises in the year.\n In addition, major banks last year were very active in new\nbourse flotations and primary and secondary bond market\nbusiness, banking analysts said.\n    Despite last week's quite strong rally, the depressed stock\nmarket and forecasts that it would probably not attract\nsustained interest from the global investment community made a\ndownturn in commission business most likely.\n    Pressure on the interest rate margin and the increasing\ncompetition posed not only by foreign banks in Germany but by\nforeign stock exchanges, particularly London, would also bring\nmore guarded prognoses for the future from board members.\n    But one banking analyst said, \"There's obviously no reason\nto paint too dark a picture. In this decade so far, the banks\nhave posted practically only record profits, with increases of\n50 pct and more. This cycle must clearly end sometime.\"\n    One problem more psychological than real was West German\nbanks' exposure to Latin American debtor nations. Bank\nofficials have said that a good 70 pct of the exposure has been\nwritten off on balance sheets.\n    Some analysts consider that the conservative accounting of\nGerman banks may in some cases have prompted the writedown of\n80 or even 100 pct of several exposures there.\n    With almost all Latin American exposure denominated in dlrs\nand written down two or three years ago, the U.S. Currency's\nfall has made further allocations to country risk reserves for\nthe region virtually unnecessary.\n    \"German bank earnings have become much more dependent on\ndevelopments on the stock exchange than on the debt question,\" a\nsecond analyst said.\n    It is precisely because of bank reporting rules that allow\nthe build up of \"hidden\" reserves known only to the Bundesbank,\nthat few analysts produced precise earnings forecasts as they\ndid for corporate non-banks.\n    But Alastair France, of London brokers Alexanders, Laing &\nCruickshank, said his clculations showed that Deutsche Bank AG\n<DBKG.F> would report a very strong 1986, boosted&by\n\u007fherMdbs\u007foa\u007f \u007fZ the FriedrichFlick \u007fnd\u007fst\u007fieve\u007fwaltung KGAA\nindustrial empire, followed by a fairly strong drop back this\nyear and flat earnings in 1988.\n    This contrasted with Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F> and\nCommerzbank AG <CBKG.F> whose earnings would drift fractionally\nlower this year and then rise modestly in 1988. On the German\nDVFA basis, Deutsche should report 59 marks per share in 1986\nand 49 marks in both ensuing years, France said.\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan is becoming dangerously isolated\nagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by\nJapanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,\nofficials and businessmen from around the world said.\n    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,\nmaking Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments\ngrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said\nthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.\n    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by\nboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.\n    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of\nJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction\ndue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\ntransformation in its traditional policies on economic\nmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\ndevelopment for Japan without this transformation.\"\n    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\nlooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\nJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\nprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\nprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\nraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\nthe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\nsemiconductor pact.\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\nblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\nplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\nby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\ntelecommunications joint venture.\n    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\nbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\nleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\n    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\nKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\nviews last November when he visited the European Community.\n\"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\nfound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\nwas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\nresults of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n    \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\naway from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\ndomestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\n    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\nPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\nonly know that your government, under the leadership of\nMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\noutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,\nunderlined by von Moltke's reference to the \"leadership\" of the\nMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\nSeptember's government programme of new economic measures.\n\"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\nthat the government has put its signature to a programme\ndesigned to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But the Plaza accord\ndid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.\n    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that\nthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A further rally in Dutch bonds is\nlikely this week, due to a lower dollar and a slightly firmer\nguilder against the mark attracting investors back to guilders\nfrom marks, bond analysts said.\n    The rally began last week, as proceeds from a sell-off in\ndollar paper flooded into stronger currencies.\n    The state tender of a new 6.25 pct eight-year bullet\nindicates a week of active trading, dealers said.\n    \"We've not had trade like this since last year's boom around\nthe May elections,\" said Wim Moret of Banque Paribas.\n    Moret was referring to the strong demand for Dutch bonds up\nto and following last year's election of Prime Minister Ruud\nLubbers, whose centre-right coalition government was pledged to\na tight economic programme which bolstered the guilder.\n    Last week, a wide sell-off of dollar and sterling boosted\ndemand for mark and guilder paper. Japanese corporate investors\nwere active buyers as the end of their accounting year, March\n31, approached.\n    Dutch prices and trade volume reached their highest level\nthis year. Total turnover topped four billion guilders, after\n3.5 billion in the previous active trading week.\n    While volume was considerable, prices rose more moderately.\nThe bourse bond index rose to 117.3 last Friday, a rise of 1.9\nagainst its level two week's earlier.\n    Foreign investors took the lion's share of trade last week,\nbut dealers noted considerable switching by domestic investors\nas the yield differential between mark and guilder issues\nenticed arbitrage activity.\n    The dollar, mark and sterling started this week even lower,\nheightening the chances of lively foreign demand for\nguilder-denominated paper, dealers said.\n    Today's declines could also be partly attributed to\ninvestors selling in a bid to force down prices ahead of the\nstate loan tender tomorrow.\n    \"This is quite a normal situation. It's natural for\ninvestors to want the highest yield for the lowest price. It\nensures firm demand at tomorrow's tender,\" one dealer said.\n     The terms of the new issue are seen drawing firm domestic\nand foreign demand, especially since the yield premium on Dutch\nlong maturities has grown to 0.45 pct over similar mark issues.\n    The loan will be the fourth state issue for payment this\nyear, and also the fourth with a 6.25 pct coupon, since Dutch\ninterest rates have changed little this year.\n    Bond analysts said that in view of the state's practice of\nweighting the bulk of its capital market borrowing in the first\nhalf of the year, it would be likely to raise at least four\nbillion guilders.\n    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson, said the\nstate has raised about 15.3 billion of its 1987 capital market\nrequirement of an estimated 32 billion guilders. Of this total,\n7.3 billion was raised on the public capital market.\n    Basing their judgement on today's market conditions,\ndealers expected the loan to be priced at 101.00 pct for a\nyield of 6.09 pct.\n    \"But everything hinges on tomorrow. If prices decline and\nyields rise, it may be priced at a fraction below that,\" one\ndealer said.\n    On the domestic front, dealers say investors are amply\ncovered by a 4.2 billion guilder nine-day special advance by\nthe Dutch central bank, which has given the money market\nsufficient liquidity until Friday, when the provision expires.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Until last week, there\nwere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.\n    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress\nover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion\ndlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from\nJapan, dramatic action is required.\n    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on\ncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere\nto a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.\n    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease\nmounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just\ntwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review\nthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.\n    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade\nsurplus in the first two months this year just underscored the\nneed for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.\n    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the\ndeficit. \"I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some\nbenefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one.\n    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate\nclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting\n\"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality.\n    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan\nand West Germany stimulating their economies and the United\nStates cutting its budget deficit.\n    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,\nagree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade\nimbalances.\n    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying\nfundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.\n    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments\nthat these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts\nagreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.\n    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined \ncooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on\ntrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem \"to want more stimulative measures\nwhich is what the Paris accord calls for.\"\n    International monetary sources said exchange market\ndevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers,\nalthough Japan is an obvious exception. \"Everybody feels it can\nstill be managed,\" one source said of market developments.\n    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five\nbillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other\ncentral banks about one billion dlrs.\n    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's\nhalf-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the\nParis accord outright.\n    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic\npolicymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that\nthe yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it\nstood at when the accord was struck.\n    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's\nuse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a\n\"pointed reminder\" to Japan to do something about the trade\nissues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.\n    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris\naccord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability\naround current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.\n    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for\nthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to\ntheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth.\n    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not\nunravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.\n    \"There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things\nalone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances\nought to be adjusted,\" one official said.\n    \"While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we\ncertainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,\"\nanother U.S. official said.\n    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be\njoined by Italy, will be a status report.\n    \"Japan will have to explain what the state of their program\nis and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need\nto move faster,\" one source said.\n    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in\neffect, for currency stability for several months. This would\nbuy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic\ngrowth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.\n    His comments appeared to serve notice on other major\nnations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to\nreduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses\nand the U.S. trade deficit.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But they said there\nwas little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the\nhigher tariffs.\n    Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong\nU.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down\nprotectionist trade legislation now being drafted.\n    He denied the action had been taken for that reason.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has\nwithdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an\nAmerican army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil\nrights in the Aegean eased.\n    A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to\ntackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept\nto Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential\nclash.\n    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing\nopposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.\n    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to\nWashington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea\nMakri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had\nprompted it to make the request were no longer valid.\n    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has\nthe right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its\nnational interests are threatened.\n    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would\nsearch for oil round three Greek islands off its coast\nfollowing an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill\neast of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led\noil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.\n    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement\nunder which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the\nAegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.\nAthens says it considers the accord inactive.\n    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had\nreceived an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out\noil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined\ncomment on the statement.\n    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the\nlong-standing continental shelf dispute to the International\nCourt of Justice at The Hague.\n    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said\nhe had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General\nSecretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said\nPhilippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercial\nbank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt\nrescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.\n    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial\ninstruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion\ninto pesos to fund government-approved equity investments\nwithin the Philippines.\n    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the\ngovernment was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs\nworth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.\n    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\n18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at the\nidea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had called\nfor substantial new commercial bank lending and development\nbank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their\neconomic troubles.\n    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed\nby these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome\nforeign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a\nbusinessmen's meeting. \"And this can now be achieved without\nforcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending.\"\n    Bankers in New York said given the booming market in\ndebt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the\nnotes at an appropriate discount.\n    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated\nsavings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year\nlife.\n    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously\nrescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between\nJanuary 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money\nlent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points\nover London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).\n    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.\n    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was\nbetter than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs\nproposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and\ngenerate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic\nenterprises.\n    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as\nwell as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western\ncreditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the\ncountry's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its\ncurrent level of 40 to 45 pct.\n    He said the country's balance of payments was now projected\nat a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a\nsurplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous\nprojected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.\n    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three\ntimes before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin\nsaid. \"What we have now is PINs IV,\" he said.\n    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain\nterms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won\na 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.\n    \"And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money\ncross the table even as of today,\" Ongpin said, adding he\nexpected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483\ncreditor banks worldwide.\n    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with\nPresident Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to\ntake a very tough stance on pricing.\n    \"But the President's instructions were unequivocal and\nunwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care\nhow long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don't\ncome home without a deal we can all be proud of',\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The U.S. Has signaled it wants the issue\nof world over-supply pushed to the top of the list of\ninternational economic issues to be negotiated this year.\n    EC diplomats say that to a large extent this view is shared\nin Europe, but the political strength of well-organised farm\nlobbies leaves ministers with little room for manoeuvre.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The dollar's tumble to a record low of\n144.70 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese\ninvestors to lighten their U.S. Bond inventory further and is\nexpected to spur diversification into investment assets\nincluding foreign and domestic shares, dealers said.\n    The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low\nof 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New York\nfinish, then recovered to 96.20-22.\n    Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment\ntrusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the\nforeign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit's\ntumble, securities house dealers said.\n    They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash\npositions resulting from their dollar sales today, and are\nsidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest\nrates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency\ntrader said.\n    The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will\nfurther promote diversification into other foreign investments,\nas well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock\nmarkets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managers\nsaid.\n    They said major Japanese investors in the past two years\nare estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign\nportfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.\nBond inventory to as low as 40 pct.\n    Since late last year, Japanese investors, seeking\nsubstantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used fresh\nfunds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after the\nParis currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds and\ngilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, the\nmanagers said.\n    Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed\ninto local bond and stock markets as well.\n    The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record\nlow of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and\ncompared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.\n    The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for\nmore than a month here, suggesting most dealers could not\nsatisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.\n    A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in\nU.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.\nThe stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to\nfunds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.\n    Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first\nhalf of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with\naverage monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of\n1986, Finance Ministry sources said.\n    The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude\ntowards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct of\ntotal foreign securities purchased, securities houses managers\nsaid.\n    Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the\nrecord high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.\n    \"Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we\nhave bought bonds in currencies such as marks, the Canadian\ndollar, the ECU and French franc,\" a fund manager at <Yasuda\nTrust and Banking Co Ltd> said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It\nsaid the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs\nfor the 1986 fourth quarter.\n    Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed\nfirst-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts\na share, by at least 40 pct. It said the first quarter of 1986\nhad been the previous income record for a single quarter.\n    Walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products,\nespecially automotive electronic fuel injection components and\ncarburetors for lawn and garden applications.\n    However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain\nthe same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due\nto an expected reduction in throttle body sales.\n    \"It now appears likely that the company's throttle body\nbusiness with General Motors Corp <GM> will peak in the first\nsix months of 1987, continue at reduced levels to July 1988 and\nsuffer an interruption for the period from July 1988 to July\n1989,\" Walbro added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Output in\nservices-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's\nlevel.\n    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a\nyear ago.\n    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for\ngoods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in\nmanufacturing and construction.\n    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,\nmachinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.\nSignificant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles\nand parts, however.\n    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and\ncommunication were more than offset by declines in\ntransportation, storage and the retail trade.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "International Business Machines Corp\n<IBM> is widely expected to deeply affect the personal computer\nindustry this week when it announces a long awaited new\ngeneration of desktop machines.\n     The four new computers, expected to be called the Personal\nSystem 2 family, are almost sure to veer away from industrywide\nstandards for personal computers that were first established by\nIBM six years ago.\n     The result id the new computers will be harder to copy and\nless likely to work with software and attachments designed for\nexisting standards. Some market researchers are already\npredicting slower growth as customers adjust to the change.\n    A proprietary IBM pc will cause the pc market's growth to\nbe flat or even negative in 1988 as vendors and users delay\npurchases to gauge the importance of the new machine,'' said\nJohn McCarthy, consultant with Forrester Research Inc.\n     IBM is traditionally very close-mouthed about unannounced\nproducts, but so intense is the interest in these machines that\nsome details have leaked out and consultants, dealers and the\ntrade press are rife with information, both factual or\nsupposed.\n    The four computers expected to be announced April 2 will\nreportedly include one low end, low cost computer, two models\nthat will resemble IBM's current high-end AT, and, most\nimportantly, a computer incorporating Intel Corp's <INTC> 80386\nmicroprocessor, the powerhouse chip that is revolutionizing the\npersonal computer.\n    The microprocessor is the brains of a computer and Intel\nmicroprocessors are the ones used in all IBM and IBM-compatible\npersonal computers, by far the largest segment of the desktop\nmarket.\n     The 80386, more commonly called the 386, processes\ncomputer instructions twice as fast as the chips used in\nexisting IBM computers and 386-based desktop computers are as\npowerful as the much larger minicomputers of a few years ago.\n     Although IBM will not be the first company to introduce a\n386 personal computer - Compaq Corp <CPQ> was - most industry\nconsultants believe that customers will not rush to embrace the\nnew generation until they see what the world's largest computer\ncompany is going to do.\n    What IBM will apparently do is introduce a computer that\nis, at least temporarily, copy-proof. That is a far different\nsituation than exists with IBM's current family of personal\ncomputers, which are cloned widely.\n     With the Personal System, IBM will reportedly build as\nmany features as possible directly into the computers'\nmotherboards, including graphics capabilities, a non-standard\nbus for add-on equipment and a new version of the operating\nsystem used on all IBM compatible computers.\n     The word in (Silicon) Valley is that it will take two mln\ndlrs and 18 months before the machines can be copied,'' said\nMichael Murphy, publisher of the newsletter California\nTechnology Stock Letter.\n      At the same time as Personal System is unveiled,\nMicrosoft Corp <MSFT> is expected to unveil a new version of\nits MS/DOS operating system, DOS 3.3, that will correct many of\nthe programming problems encountered on earlier versions of the\nsoftware. MS/DOS is used with all IBM personal computers.\n      Consultants said that most existing IBM-compatible\nsoftware will run on the new computers but software written\nspecifically for the Personal System will not run on older\nmodels.\n     The industry will be looking closely at the delivery dates\nfor the new computers, particularly the 386, because if IBM\ndoes not start shipping its entry in this important new market\nsoon, Compaq will continue to gain larger and larger market\nshare.\n    Market researcher Future Computing Inc estimated that\nCompaq's Deskpro 386, which started shipping last October, is\ngenerating sales of between 3.5 mln and and four mln dlrs a\nmonth. In the first six months of availability between 21 and\n24 mln dlrs worth of Deskpro 386s were sold.\n    Said Future Computing analyst Joe Cross, \"That's some\nindication of the kind of money IBM is leaving on the table.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries\nfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the\ncountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.\n    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid\nneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.\n    The letter said the government had to step in \"to avert\nserious economic hardship\" and because the Social Services\nMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision\nof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.\n    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six\nmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop\nwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and\nother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of\nsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.\n    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha\n(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been \"almost completely\ndevastated,\" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now\nestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally\nexpected.\n    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high\nforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate\nrainfall within the next three to four weeks.\n    \"Should the present drought continue, however, production is\nestimated at around 20 mln bushels,\" the letter added.\n    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90\nand 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last\nyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.\n    The letter said villagers in most seriously affected\ndistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because\nsubsidiary crops had also failed.\n    It said the government's current budget did not permit it\nto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.\n\"Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity\nprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue\nto exert pressure on the expenditure side.\"\n    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per\nmonth for each family, as well as handling, transport and\ndistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by\nthe government would not be possible without seriously\nimpairing development projects, or \"greatly fuelling inflation\"\nin the economy, the letter said.\n    The letter said the Food Department would be able to\nrelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the\nimmediate cereal requirements \"provided such stocks are replaced\nsubsequently.\"\n    The Meteorological Department said the country was\nexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month\ndry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when\nthe monsoon rains fell in late May.\n    The letter said some areas had been experiencing the\ndrought since August, and in the rice growing district of\nKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June\n1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Primary Market Makers\nAssociation, a trade organisation, said its board last week\nadopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond\nissues make a market in that security for 12 months.\n    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part\nof firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no\nformal obligation to do so.\n    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in\nexplaining why the recommendation was adopted, said \"It is aimed\nat the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and\ndisappears.\"\n    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to\nadhere to the rule. \"We're under no illusions about the legal\nbinding force of these recommendations,\" he said.\n    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to\nsupport an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has\nbeen offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one\nto buy it back from them.\n    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates\nnotes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the\nsecurities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17\nbillion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.\n     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board\nonly applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have\nhelped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.\n    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the\ncriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of\nthe smaller firms.\n    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead\nmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally\ndistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of\neight other major currencies.\n    The former requirement called for three lead-managed\nissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance\nrequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six\nto 10 members.\n    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict\nmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive\nand that it reinforces the big firms' already large market\nshare.\n    \"Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with\nborrowers,\" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. \"The borrower\nsays to himself, \"Well I can travel economy or I can travel\nfirst class,'\" he said.\n    Sibson defended the new rules saying \"We have to steer a\ncourse between representing the interests of the major market\nmakers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody.\"\n    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expanded\nto the point where the former minimum size requirements were\njust too small.\n    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with the\nAssociation of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,\nsubmitting daily information on prices on issues in which they\nare market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to be\ndetermined.\n    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and\nsecondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriate\nmarket price for their securities. Such a rule would make\ninvestors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and\nwould increase liquidity, they said.\n    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yet\nbeen spelled out. But previous discussion of the reporting\nrequirement considered firms listing the closing price of a\ngiven security as well as the high and low for the day.\n     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on the\nimplementation of a new communications system which enables a\nlead manager to invite all potential management group members\nin to a deal at the same time.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Much of the momentum\nwas derived from the futures market, where a high 33,074 lots\nwere traded in the long gilt June contract.\n    The Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 closed 1-7/16\npoint lower at 135-20/32 stg pct while the Treasury 10 pct due\n1991 ended at 105-12/32 for a fall of 1-3/16.\n    Dealers noted that market confidence had already been at a\nlow ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled away\nlast week as investors reacted nervously to opinion polls\nshowing unexpectedly strong gains for the centrist\nLiberal/Social Democratic alliance.\n    The market had been sustained in large part during its\nrecent rally by a virtual conviction that the ruling\nConservative party would first call and then win a general\nelection early this summer.\n    However, advances credited to the alliance last week have\ncast doubt on both assumptions.\n    \"Turnover in the cash market has actually been quite small,\"\none dealer said, adding that price movements had been very\nvolatile at times.\n    After losing ground heavily in the Far East in tandem with\nthe flagging dollar, U.S. Bonds fell further in London trading\nbut showed some signs of recovery late in the U.S. Morning as\nthe dollar steadied a little against the yen. The latest period\nof weakness for the dollar has accentuated fears that currency\nrisk might induce Japanese investors in particular to undertake\ndramatic reductions in their portfolios of U.S. Treasury\nissues.\n    Dealers noted that early strength in the index-linked\nsector of the market, which had enabled the Government broker\nto supply some of both index-linked stock tranches announced on\nFriday, had soon fallen prey to the general depression\naffecting gilts.\n    The Treasury 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2020 closed\njust under one point lower at 100-11/32 stg pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But quotas must be\nnegotiated sometime, he said.\n     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas\nbut that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower\nits export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates\nsaid.\n     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO\nboard is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the\nreintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some\nadministrative matters, according to a draft agenda.\n    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio\nDauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and\nchief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the\nmeeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a\nnon-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.\n    \"I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among\nproducers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal\nby September (the next scheduled council meeting),\" Bronwyn\nCurtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.\n    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a\ndate will be set for an earlier council meeting.\n    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the\ncoffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the\nremainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.\n    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest\ncoffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another\nfor sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.\n    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,\nunder which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,\nbut consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares\nto be redistributed using \"objective criteria,\" which would have\nthreatened Brazil's share.\n    At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,\nCosta Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their\nobjections as members of the group of eight ICO \"dissident\"\nproducers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in\nprices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez\nCuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief\nproducers on the Managua meeting.\n    However, other producers said they were not aware of this\nmove toward producer solidarity.\n    London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today,\ndown from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Congress is making Japan,\nwith its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the\nU.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around\nAmerica's record trade deficit.\n    \"Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the\nchallenge to our high technology industries, the threat of\ngovernment nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers\nto our exports,\" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.\n    \"If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade\nproblems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,\"\nthe West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee\nhearing on the trade bill.\n    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have\nmade trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging\nbill is being readied for probable House approval next month.\n    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs\nin 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14\nbillion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.\n    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade\ndeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to\nthe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to\npress Japan to buy more U.S. goods.\n    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration\nin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.\n    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.\nsemiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he\nintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese\nelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by\na 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.\n    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's\nlack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues\nincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications\ngoods, and financial services.\n    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in\nfour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and\nmeasures to force the administration take tough action against\nforeign trade barriers and unfair competition.\n    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many\ncases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese\nproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties.\n    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House\nWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to\nforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign\ncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win\ntemporary relief from surges in imports.\n    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict\nimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not\nbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.\n    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant\nfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key\nDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment.\n    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West\nGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does\nnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would\nset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per\ncent a year for three years.\n    \"I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say\nto me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't\ncompete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken\naway from American business,\" Gephardt said.\n    The administration has said it could not support a trade\nbill containing such a provision.\n    \n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Senate has approved a\nmeasure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks\nto write off loan losses over 10 years.\n    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was\nattached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan\nInsurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.\n    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks\nwith assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of\ntotal loans in farm loans -- to write down over 10 years\nagricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.\n    Dixon said current law, which requires losses to be\ndeducted immediately from bank capital, \"forces banks to try not\nto acknowledge the extent of their problems.\"\n    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said farm banks have been\nconcerned that write-downs might reduce their capitalization\nbelow the six pct regulatory requirement.\n    Last year Congress urged federal regulators to use\nforbearance in the assessment of agricultural loans. However,\nKassebaum said \"only a miniscule number of banks\" have qualified\nfor the capital forbearance provisions.\n    Dixon's measure also would allow agricultural banks to\namortize losses on the reduced value of farmland acquired in\nthe handling of agricultural loans.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The cut could\nlead to further layoffs at GM, it said.\n    A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future \nproduction schedules.\n    Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, which\nhas high car inventories.\n    A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM part\nof the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz,\nanalyst with Montgomery Securities.\n    \"They should be cutting a lot more than they are,\" Shearson\nLehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even if\nGM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarter\nproduction, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.\n    Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the end\nof March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.\n    Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000\nexcess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.\n    The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs,\nalthough those would likely be temporary rather than indefinite\nlayoffs, said Lucky.\n    He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunity\nto close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut two\nor three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more in\nline with demand.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nigeria plans to issue on April 7 a\nfurther 1.5 billion dlrs in short-term promissory notes to its\nuninsured trade creditors in connection with existing arrears\non those debts, Law Debenture Trust Corp Plc said as trustee\nfor the notes.\n    It said Nigeria also plans to hold talks with a newly\nappointed representative for those creditors fairly soon, and\nthat Nigeria also will call \"at an early date\" an extraordinary\nmeeting of noteholders, including holders of the new notes. The\npurpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to the\narrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes.\n    Nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the notes\nlast autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that was\ndue in early January because of a cash shortage, which stemmed\npartly from the drop in oil prices last year.\n    An official of the Law Debenture Trust said he did not know\nwhen the new representative for the noteholders, David Murison,\nwould meet the Nigerians. He noted the Nigerians currently are\nattempting to negotiate bilateral agreements with members of\nthe Paris Club of western creditor governments under a\nmultilateral pact on these debts reached in December. So far,\nbilateral accords have been reached with the U.K. And France.\n    Law Debenture Trust, as trustee for the notes, has been\nattempting to organise a meeting between the note holders and\nNigeria for the last coupole of months. The appointment of\nMurison, chairman of Westpac Banking Corp's Mase Westpac Ltd\nunit in London, was made in an effort to better coordinate\nthese efforts.\n    The Law Debenture official said Murison will begin talks\nwith Nigeria as soon as they return to London. And although it\nis hoped that a meeting of all note holders could be held by\nend-May, he said this may not be possible since four weeks\nnotice of the meeting is required by law.\n    The discussions with the note holders are being held in\nconjunction with proposals to rescheduling Nigeria's debt to\ncommercial banks and official credit agencies.\n    When talks began last April on rescheduling part of the\ncountry's approximate 19 billion dlrs of foreign debt, the\ncommercial banks insisted that it be contingent on Nigeria\nobtaining a rescheduling of its official debts as well. The\nNigerians then extended this to include all uninsured trade\ndebt.\n    The commercial bank package has yet to be signed due in\npart to the reluctance of Japanese banks, which have a\nrelatively small exposure, to participate.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Floating-rate notes denominated in a\nforeign currency, a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street, will\nprobably be issued infrequently because the so-called \"window\nof opportunity\" opens and closes quickly, traders say.\n    \"In just two days we had as many issues. As a result, the\nmarket became glutted,\" said one trader.\n    He said the window depends more on supply than on foreign\nexchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment.\n\"Obviously, currency risk is important. But there is a limited\nnumber of investors right now for the paper,\" he said.\n    On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mln\nNew Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes\nissued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co <F>.\n    The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, and\nquarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day New\nZealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life.\n    This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offering\nof the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical\nCo <DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set on\nApril 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below\nthe same 90-day New Zealand rate.\n    Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate\nfloor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,\nunderwriters said.\n    But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mln\nNew Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by\nGeneral Electric Co's <GE> General Electric Credit Corp via\nPrudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.\n    \"Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters\nand face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply,\" an\nunderwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted\nthat the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.\n    An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed\nout that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow\ndid, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.\n    Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date\nfirst surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,\ncompanies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a\nforeign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But\nthe issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.\n    \"I would say that every company which issued foreign\ncurrency debt saved some basis points when compared to\nsame-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues,\" an analyst said.\n    Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early\nissues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to\nabsorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides\nposted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such\nissuance to a quick halt.\n    It was not until late last year, after the currencies\nstabilized, that companies again started issuing debt\ndenominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n    But many investors have still shied away from the debt,\nremembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New\nZealand dollars, analysts noted.\n    To attract some of those investors back to the fold,\nunderwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign\ncurrency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.\n    This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the\ncourse of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and\npredictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields\nwould rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.\n    A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford\nCredit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day\nof offering. \"That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New\nZealand dollar note issues,\" he said.\n    However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate\nsaid the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache\ndid not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.\n    They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by\nMoody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, while\nthe General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate\nterms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried\ntop-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.\n    \"We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-day\nsales on a Friday afternoon, I'm happy with the results,\" an\nofficer on Prudential-Bache's syndicate desk said.\n    Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign\ncurrency-denominated notes, underwriters said.\n    Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of New\nZealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few\nweeks away.\n    \"I would like to underwrite a deal a day. But with the Dow,\nFord and GE offerings, the marketplace has had enough for the\ntime being,\" the Prudential-Bache officer admitted.\n    Meanwhile, IDD Information Services said the 30-day\ncorporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last week\nfrom 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently\nclosed down,\" one exporter said.\n    However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is\nlikely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the\nInternational Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in\nLondon decides to call a full council meeting to discuss\nreintroduction of export quotas, sources said.\n    There is also talk of the announcement this week of new\nmeasures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be\nawaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters\nsaid.\n    Another factor which could be delaying the opening of\nregistrations is the current strike by bank workers which,\nwhile not affecting current shipments, could affect\ndocumentation and currency operations for new sales.\n    This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering\nobliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or\nthree days of registering a sale.\n\u0003",

He was in Houston to address the annual meeting of the\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers.\n    \"We're trying to grow in that area to cushion the oil price\nvolatility,\" Hall said.\n    Hall said Ashland is seeking a chemical company acquisition\nwhich would complement its existing chemical businesses which\nmanufacture adhesives, polyester resins and other products.\n    When asked if Ashland is considering divesting its\nmoney-losing oil exploration and production unit, he said \"we\ndo not have any spin-offs planned at this time.\"\n    Hall said the Ashland, Ky., based oil company would have\nstrong margins on its chemical products throughout 1987, adding\n\"right now we're struggling a bid\" with the company's refining\nand marketing margins.\n    The Ashland chairman also said he hoped the U.S. government\nwould consider some form of tax incentive to help develop\ncostly synthetic fuels such as oil shales and coal\nliquification. \"The lead time on that (kind of project) is so\nlong, it's difficult for a private company or a company with\nshareholders to pay for reseach,\" he explained.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac\ncalled on leading Western nations to set up a mechanism which\nwould put a stop to volatile foreign exchange rates.\n    In a speech prepared for delivery to businessmen and\nbankers in New York, Chirac said said monetary stablility was a\nkey element in bringing the world financial system back to\nhealth.\n    \"The industrialized states should agree to set up a monetary\nframework which would provide the necessary stability as well\nas sufficient flexibility to allow ajustments when needed,\"\nChirac said.\n    \"This requires a monitoring and alert mechanism which would\npermit a timely and concerted reaction,\" he said.\n    The prime minister, on the first day of a three-day visit\nto the United States, said the February 22 Paris accords agreed\nby the \"Group of Five\" industrial nations should serve as a basis\nfor the new mechanism.\n     Under the Paris accords, the United States, Britain,\nFrance, West Germany, and Japan agreed to stabilize exchange\nrates around existing parities. But, only five weeks after they\nwere signed, they have failed to stop the dollar tumbling to\nrecord lows against the yen.\n    Chirac said the means to monitor exchange rate movements\nwere readily available. \"What is needed is the political will to\nuse these more completely, in the spirit of the Paris\naccords... \"\n    In other points of his speech, Chirac called on countries\nwith high trade surpluses -- an apparent reference to Japan --\nto open up their markets and stimulate demand.\n    He warned the United States that protectionist measures as\ndebated in the U.S. Congress would bring a tough  response from\nthe 12-nation European Community.\n    \"Europe is very sensitive to every rumour of protectionism.\nIt will react with energy and solidarity because it does not\nwant to ruin its chances of recovery.\"\n    The Reagan administration is seeking to tone down a tough\ntrade bill which if passed would require the president to\nretaliate against countries deemed to discriminate against U.S.\nGoods.\n    Chirac also appealed for an effort from developed countries\nto help the Third World by reducing interest rates and\nstimulating commodity prices.\n    \"No stock-pile mechanism can run counter to the underlying\ntrend of the market. These agreements must be complemented by\nfinancial aid to the developing countries hardest hit by the\ndecline.\"\n    Chirac said he hoped concrete steps could be reached on\nthese issues at forthcoming international meetings -- the\nInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank session in Washington\nand the June summit of seven leading western nations in Venice.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He thinks history has shown\nsuch sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. \"The\nbear usually strikes slowly,\" he said.\n    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of the\nrally that took the market to record highs last week. In\ntoday's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming more\ninto a more normal alignment with the general market.\n    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimately\nthe pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaited\ncorrection. But for now he believes the bull market remains\nintact. However, it could take several weeks for the market to\ncomplete a \"distribution process\" and along the way there will\nbe rallies.\n    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today's\naction signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the market\ncan hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.\n    \"This probably is the correction that has been expected,\"\nsaid Crandall Hays of Robert W. Baird Co.\n    Hays noted that market breadth began to deteriorate last\nweek. He said this morning investors saw the dollar down\nfurther, interest rates up and gold up. \"The trade problem got\npeople spooked and and all the bad things were happening at\nonce,\" he said.\n    \"This correction could take us down 150 points and we're\nhalf-way there now,\" he said early today.\n    He thinks the downward move in stock prices could be over\nin a couple of weeks. Business conditions seem to be getting\nbetter according to what he hears from a broad cross-section of\ncompanies, from retailers to machinery manufacturers.\n    \"The market was high and people were looking for a\ncorrection, so this was an excuse for the market to go down,\"\nsaid Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co.\n    He believes investors will be in a mood of extreme caution\nor slightly negative for the near term.\n    Ackerman thinks the U.S. is attempting to \"fire a shot\nacross Japan's bow and let them know we're serious about having\ncloser trade ties.\" But nevertheless investors have been\nrattled by \"a perception that a full scale trade war is\npossible.\" Ultimately, unless there is an accord, the effects\ncould be higher interest rates and unemployment, he said.\n    \"I anticipate a further correction later this week,\" said\nHarry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony, R.L. Day. He thinks the\npullback was \"the start of an overdue correction of between six\nand 10 pct from the market highs.\"\n    Although investors now have new reason to worry about\nhigher interests rate and a return of inflation, Laubscher\nsays, \"it is not the end of the bull market.\"\n    \"The market was looking for a reason to knock itself down a\nlittle bit, and with the trade sanctions coming largely as a\nsurprise, this was the think the market attached itself to,\"\nsaid Gary Ciminero of Fleet Financial Group.\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in\nParis last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection\nwith their pact to stabilise currencies.\n    Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why\nthe participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson\nreplied, \"we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.\"\nWhen asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float\nwith set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said \"I do not\nwant to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not\nto make it easy for\" speculation against the accord.\n    Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual\ncountries would take corrective action if their currency began\nreacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.\n    But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,\nLawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid\nthrough concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.\n    \"It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having\ndifficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate\nappreciations and making their economies more domestically\noriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to\nmake its own economy more export oriented,\" Lawson said.\n    In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury\nCommittee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's\ncurrent level, adding that \"It is an objective ... To try to\nkeep it around that level.\"\n    He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had\nchanged since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the\npound had weathered that period so successfully. \"There has been\na reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,\" Lawson said.  He\ndisagreed with what he termed \"the grossly exaggerated claim\"\nthat real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of\nother major industrialsed countries.\n    Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank\nrate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real\ninterest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and\nonly a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.\n    Lawson confirmed that \"over the medium and longer term, the\ngovernment's objective is zero inflation.\"\n    He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at\n1.0 pct of GDP \"is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget\ndoctrine.\"  He added that \"to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain\nconstant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply\na recipe for accelerating inflation.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",
