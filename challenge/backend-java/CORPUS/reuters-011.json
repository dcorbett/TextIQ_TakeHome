Aides to\nChiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.\n    Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a report\nlisting possible price and income support program savings.\n    The options included lowering target prices, increasing\nunpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income support\npayments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use of\ngeneric commodity certificates, raising loan rates and\n\"decoupling\" income support payments from production decisions.\n    Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing the\nU.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functions\nwhich include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.\n    The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrs\nfor organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Primary Market Makers\nAssociation, a trade organisation, said its board last week\nadopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond\nissues make a market in that security for 12 months.\n    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part\nof firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no\nformal obligation to do so.\n    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in\nexplaining why the recommendation was adopted, said \"It is aimed\nat the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and\ndisappears.\"\n    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to\nadhere to the rule. \"We're under no illusions about the legal\nbinding force of these recommendations,\" he said.\n    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to\nsupport an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has\nbeen offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one\nto buy it back from them.\n    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates\nnotes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the\nsecurities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17\nbillion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.\n     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board\nonly applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have\nhelped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.\n    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the\ncriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of\nthe smaller firms.\n    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead\nmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally\ndistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of\neight other major currencies.\n    The former requirement called for three lead-managed\nissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance\nrequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six\nto 10 members.\n    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict\nmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive\nand that it reinforces the big firms' already large market\nshare.\n    \"Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with\nborrowers,\" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. \"The borrower\nsays to himself, \"Well I can travel economy or I can travel\nfirst class,'\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The group, which is led by the\nwealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify\nany of the other people with whom it had talks.\n    Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman\nDudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion\ndlr offer for the company.\n    At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,\nGoldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and\nto supply financial data to other interested bidders.\n    \"If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president\nis because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them\nbacking him on any deal,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be\nidentified.\n    \"I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like\nthey're going to join the group and buy themselves out,\" said\nEdward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham\nand Co.\n    Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be\ninterested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be\none of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.\n    Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2\npct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.\n    Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of\nTaft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values\nfor the company.\n    Several analysts had estimated a break up value of less\nthan 150. One analyst said he believes it has a breakup value\nof 160 to 165 dlrs per share.\n    Taft stock closed at 156-1/2, up 1-3/4.\n    \"They (investors) are saying here's another one - another\nfamily dispute,\" said Dennis McAlpine of Oppenheimer.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Texas lost seven\nand Michigan and Wyoming were each down by three rigs. Gains\nwere reported in Louisiana and California, which increased by\nseven and six, respectively.\n    In Canada, the rig count dropped by 52 to a total of 131\nworking rigs, against 222 one year ago. Kerridge attributed the\nsteep drop to the government's annual springtime ban against\nrigs and other heavy equipment being transported over\nrain-softened highways.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Last\nyear, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the\nUnited States in these products.\n    Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.\n    \"It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I\nhope it will persuade them we're serious,\" Smart said of the\nWhite House trade sanctions.\n    The United States has tried to convince Japanese car\ncompanies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw\nthem away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.\n    \"All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them\nwe can do better than our reputation seems to be,\" he said.\n    Measured per car, each American-made car contained about\n700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car\ncontained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)\nwould apply the so-called \"0/92\" option to all 1987 program crops\nor, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.\n    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)\nwere considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains\nproducers to receive final deficiency payments in March instead\nof in October.\n    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiency\npayments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately\nthree billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting\ninstead of in the fall.\n    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment that\nwould offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers\nfor any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation\nreserve program last year.\n    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up\nfor the corn program this spring. The U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn\nbonus offer.\n    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplating\nan amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheat\nproducers who were prevented from planting this spring because\nof flooding last year.\n    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that would\nallow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the quality\nof their crop was hurt by flooding last year.\n    Democrats and Republicans today were still trying to arrive\nat an agreement governing time to be devoted to amendments.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Federal Reserve's move to easier\nmonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate\ncuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the\nsecond quarter, analysts said.\n    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to\nedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate\nfrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.\n    \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without\na full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financial\neconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    Stone said economic data available by late June may be just\nweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said\nit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half\npoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.\n    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly\nquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury\nbond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which\nbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime\nlending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.\n    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to\nthe April-June quarter, follow:\n    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further\nagainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget\ndeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after\nthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the\neconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that\nthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.\n    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue\ntrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well\ntest the lower end of that range.\n    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and\nprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong\nforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The\noutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year\nsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.\n    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator\nwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The\nsharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will\na mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.\n    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct\nannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at\nrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first\nand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct\nannual\nrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees\nboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among\nthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct\nrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this\nquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.\n    \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many\nexpect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in\ninventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter\neconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later.\n    \"We're running out of special factors to keep the economy\nafloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His\ninterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.\n    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation\nhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.\nHe expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second\nquarter growth could be zero or negative.\n    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer\nfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow \ngovernment spending and less construction. Only a marginally\nnarrower trade deficit will add to growth.\n    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,\nwith Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,\nrespectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for\nbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.\n    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly\nafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past\ndays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.\n    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc\nraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20\npct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.\n    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted\nhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point\nto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and\nResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.\n    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese\ninvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear\nabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.\ntrade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.\n......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS....\n....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime..\nNikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..\nMoney Mkt Services...8.00......6.25......7.50..\nDiscount Corp........7.75......6.25......7.50..\nMerrill Lynch........7.30......5.75......7.50..\nBankers Trust........7.25......5.50......7.50..\nWells Fargo Bank.....7.30......5.60......7.00..\nIrving Securities....7.10......5.50......7.00..\nDean Witter..........7.00......5.50......7.00..\n.FORECAST AVERAGE....7.50......5.875.....7.50..\n.CURRENT LEVELS......7.80......6.125.....7.50..\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "European Community (EC) agriculture\nministers gave widely diverging reactions to EC executive\nCommission proposals for a radical reduction of guaranteed\nprices for the EC's 12 mln farmers.\n    The plans, which could cut the price received by farmers by\nover 10 pct in many cases, were dismissed by West German\nminister Ignaz Kiechle as in part unacceptable and in part not\neven a basis for negotiation, diplomatic sources said.\n    At the other end of the scale, Britain's Michael Jopling\nsaid for some products they did not go far enough to reduce the\nmassive spending on the EC's farm policy, the major factor\nwhich has brought the Community close to a budget crisis.\n    Ministers discussed the Commission's 1987-88 farm price\nproposals for the first time and the sources said negotiations\ncould last several months yet.\n    Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker, who is chairing the\nmeeting, told his colleagues he would not even attempt to reach\nagreement at the current meeting which is due to end Tuesday\nalthough prices are supposed to be agreed by April 1.\n    The disagreement among ministers reflects deep divisions\namong member states about the future of the EC's farm policy\nwhich swallows about two-thirds of the annual 36 billion\nEuropean Currency Unit (41 billion dollar) budget.\n    Kiechle, backed generally by his French, Italian and\nseveral other colleagues, believes sacrifices by traditional\nfamily farmers must be kept to a minimum in order to maintain\nviable rural communities in Europe.\n    Jopling, with some support from the Netherlands and\nDenmark, on the whole backs proposals by EC farm commissioner\nFrans Andriessen to cut guaranteed prices and reduce the\nopportunities for sales of surplus products into EC stores.\n    He believes the system which allows such sales nominally as\na last resort has become abused, resulting in huge stocks and\ndamaging trade tensions with other major world food exporters.\n    Jopling told journalists it was now costing the EC 2,000\nEcus a hectare (920 dlrs an acre) to subsidise cotton\nproduction and double that figure for the growing of certain\ntypes of tobacco.\n    Opening yesterday's debate, Andriessen accused officials of\nsome EC states of ignoring realities. \"They give the impression\nof living on another planet where there are no surpluses, no\nbudgetary deficits and no budgetary discipline for farm\nspending,\" he said.\n    One Andriessen scheme for closing the budget gap could\nalready be doomed, diplomats said.\n    He wants to raise two billion Ecus (2.28 billion dlrs)\nthrough a tax on EC produced and imported oilseeds which has\nalready raised hackles in Washington because of fears of the\nimpact on U.S. soybean exports.\n    Jopling said earlier enough EC states appear opposed to\nthis scheme to block its adoption provided they all stand firm\nin the lengthy negotiations ahead on the Commission proposals.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. Department of\nTransportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the\nproposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American\nAirlines Inc.\n    \"The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen\ncompetition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,\" the\nDOT said in a statement.\n    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a\nunit of AMR Corp.\n    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan\nFeb. 20.\n    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of\nrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small\ncarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the\nnation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not\nalter American's third-place ranking, according to data\ncompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.\n    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.\nmarket to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.\n    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially\nreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers\nprovide either nonstop or single-plane service.\n    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT\nsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could not\nincrease or begin service that competed with a merged\nAmerican-AirCal.\n    Concerning the 14th, \"While entry may not be possible at the\nOrange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the\nservice provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,\nespecially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will\nprovide effective competition for Orange County travelers in\nlong-haul markets,\" the DOT said.\n    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the\nauthorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County\nterminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal\nbuilding limit future opportunities for expansion.\n    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments\nopposing the merger but \"raised no new facts or arguments.\"\n    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will\npay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

By the turn of\nthe century, world oil prices will be significantly higher\nbecause of declining supplies, McMillan said.\n    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the\nmeeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help\nspur development of synthetic fuels.\n    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons\nof demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that\nof all the world's known oil reserves.\n    \"We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels\ncompetitive later,\" Hall said. The average lead time for\ndevelopment of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between\nfive and ten years.\n    Until last year, the federal government had subsidized\nsynfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a\nresearch program created during the Carter Administration with\nthe goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels\nof oil.\n    The corporation was shut down last April when Congress\nrefused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget\nbecause of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a\nbarrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

For the past year, the dollar in\nthe parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above\nthe official rate.\n    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery\nand industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the\nparallel market without having to wait for an official order\nfrom the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).\n    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an\neffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate\nthe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the\neconomy.\n    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council\n(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's\ntrade policy, with participation of the private sector.\n    The Council had been closed three years ago by the military\ngovernment of former President Joao Figueiredo.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But I don't see that as a likely scenario,\" Pulcine said.\n    Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the\nBrazilian debt situation was so complex that \"it could drag on\nbeyond one full fiscal year.\"\n    He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings\nforecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly\ninterest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs\nor about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brazilian President Jose Sarney\nannounced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of\nU.S. Dollar currency in the parallel market, aimed at promoting\nimports of foreign goods.\n    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face\n\"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the\npurchase of goods.\"\n    The parallel market, although tolerated, is technically\nillegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market\nis being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate.\n    Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers of\nmachinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in\nthe parallel market without having to wait for the issuing of\nan official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade\nDepartment (Cacex).\n    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an\neffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate\nthe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the\neconomy.\n    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council\n(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's\ntrade policy, with participation of the private sector.\n    The Council had been closed three years ago by the military\ngovernment of former President Joao Figueiredo.\n    Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion\ndollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials\nhave suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to\nseek a renegotiation with its creditors.\n    Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a\nmust to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12\nbillion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which\ndropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars.\n    He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade\nbalance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised\ncountries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis\nfaced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

William Reynolds \nsaid the offer is a \"highly conditional, contingently financed\nbust-up offer\" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value\nof their investment in Gencorp.\n    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the\noffer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He\nsaid the board has authorized management to explore\nalternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a\n\"financially superior\" alternative to the general acquisition\noffer.\n    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not\ncomment on market speculation that the company's management may\ndevelop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not\ncomment on when a better alternative might be developed.\n    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer\nprice since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at\n114-1/4, up 1-5/8.\n    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,\nGencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder\nvalue, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he\njoined the company.\n    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a \"bargain price\"\nacquisition that was \"using financing from a syndicate of banks\nthat does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman\nbrothers that shearson is not obligated to provide.\"\n    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical\nalteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet\nGeneral to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the\nprofits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of\nshareholders.\n    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer\n\"jeopardizes the security and interests\" of its shareholders,\nemployees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout\nthe country where the company's facilities are located.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Philippine government has quietly\nagreed to make token payments of principal in each of the next\nthree years as part of its 10.3 billion dlr commercial bank\ndebt rescheduling package finalized last Friday, bankers said.\n    Manila will pay foreign banks 37 mln dlrs a year in 1987,\n1988 and 1989, representing four pct of a 925 mln dlr loan\nsigned in 1985. Amortizations on the loan were not due to begin\nuntil 1990, but the Philippines agreed to make the extra 111\nmln dlr prepayment in order to win a relatively low interest\nmargin of 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, bankers said.\n    Bankers said they insisted on the principal repayments so\nthat they could justify a margin of 7/8 pct by drawing a direct\nparallel between the Philippines and Venezuela, which won a 7/8\npct spread on a 21 billion dlr debt rescheduling package last\nmonth.\n    After the Venezuelan deal was clinched, leading New York\nbankers hurried to argue that 7/8 pct was the new benchmark\nspread for a debtor nation that was current on interest, was\nnot seeking new money and was amortizing loan principal.\n    Previously, the 13/16 pct margin granted to Mexico was seen\nby debtors as the margin to strive for.\n    The Philippines, which met the first two Venezuelan\ncriteria but not the third, was adamant that it could not\naccept a spread higher than 7/8 pct.\n    Bankers could not back down either because they would have\nhad to sacrifice millions of dollars in profits and may have\nthrown the door open to other debtors, notably Argentina and\nBrazil, to claim even finer spreads than Mexico's.\n    In the end, the compromise saved face for the banks. \"The\nbanks were agonizing how to reconcile this package with\nVenezuela's. This allowed them to walk out and say, We've kept\nfaith with the Venezuelan precedent,\" one source said.\n    The prepayments, although modest, were not apparently\nsomething that the Philippine negotiators wanted to dwell upon\nas they sought to portray their 17-year rescheduling agreement\nas better than Mexico's.\n    Finance minister Jaime Ongpin did not refer to the\nprepayments at a news conference he held in New York on Friday\nto announce the rescheduling agreement.\n    And an accompanying press release referred only obliquely\nto the fact that the 7/8 pct margin will increase to one pct\n\"as long as the Philippines pays amortizations as agreed with\nthe banks.\"\n    The threat of a higher margin gives the Philippines every\nincentive to make the extra payments, and the government has\nindicated that it will in fact do so, bankers said.\n    Furthermore, by paying back ahead of schedule some of the\nlast loan it raised, the Philippines will be hoping to make a\ngood impression on the international banking community.\n    Ongpin said the country should not have a financing gap\nbefore the end of next year at the earliest, depending on the\nsuccess of the Philippine Investment Note issues which are\nplanned, but some bankers say they are already braced for new\nloan requests for 1988 and 1989.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said there is a 40 pct chance\nthat crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of\nthe year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.\n    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement\nto restrict production.\n    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June\nbecause the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has\ndeclined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.\n    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar\nhas fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.\n    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to\nfour mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to\ntwo mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

At\nstake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts which\nthe Japanese government had previously intended to award to\ndomestic firms.\n    The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's self\ndefence forces, will be equipped with high technology radar\ndodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very low\naltitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.\n    The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all\n77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.\n    A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of the\nannouncement had nothing to do with escalating trade friction\nbetween Japan and the U.S., Its largest trading partner.\n    \"This is an objective decision, made after discussions with\nU.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger,\" he said.\n    However, with two weeks to go before the U.S. Imposes\ntariffs, Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, told\nForeign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must address\nindividual market-opening issues, such as the FSX, defence\nministry officials said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> said\nits 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices\ncombined with a large tax provision.\n    Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to\n17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group\nrevenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.\n    It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit\nbut instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely\nrelated to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses\nand tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not\nrecognised in the accounts.\n    Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full\nyear sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the\nShelf project, against six month sales in 1985.\n    Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas\nand liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.\n    Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd\n<STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas.\n    Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale\nwould be included in the 1987 accounts.\n    It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6\nmln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Charges of public sector waste,\ncorruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid the\ncompliments in debates at the annual session of China's\nparliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).\n    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the China\nInternational Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), who\nalso represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the \"profit before\neverything\" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlement\nand extravagant gifts and banquets.\n    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.\n    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members on\nPremier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.\n    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provinces\nsaid Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.\nOne said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pct\nof total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today.\n\"This is incompatible with the important place occupied by\nagriculture,\" he said.\n    Other deputies said the state had broken promises to\nimprove fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.\n    Although another congress member was quoted by the agency\nas saying Zhao's opening speech last week was \"discreet,\nappropriate, comprehensive and assuring,\" others said the\ngovernment had spent too much or too little.\n    One member, described as a person with no party\naffiliation, said people were worried about the state's budget\ndeficit, projected to reach more than two billion dlrs this\nyear.\n    \"The deficit is due not only to the sharp drop in oil price,\nbut also to lavishness and waste of funds, which should be\nstopped,\" he said.\n    \"The National People's Congress used to be a rubber stamp,\nbut now it is a little bit more than that,\" said a western\ndiplomat, referring to the range of debate.\n    Another western diplomat said the Communist Party had\ngranted a slightly greater role to the Congress in the last two\nor three years and some of its members were testing out their\ninfluence.\n    The committee's decision to strike from the agenda a\ncontroversial plan to give greater power to management of state\nenterprises and less to local party committees caused raised\neyebrows, the diplomat added.\n    One diplomat said Zhao's keynote speech could emerge in\nslightly amended form at the end of the 2-1/2 week session in\nthe Great Hall of the People.\n    She said there had been similar changes one year ago, when\nthe Congress added words about the importance of ideological\neducation and the need to help poorer provinces left behind in\nChina's uneven march to greater prosperity.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Workers in China's rural\nfactories are struggling against a variety of problems to\nmaintain the momentum of progress since industrialisation of\nthe countryside began in the 1970s.\n    \"When I was a child, we had no bicycles. We went everywhere\non foot. The land here is salty, so the harvests were not good.\nMoney and food were inadequate. When it rained, the water\nleaked through the grass roof,\" said Li Wenxian, 31, of Hongshan\nin Zhejiang. Now he and other villagers live in large\ntwo-storey concrete homes with balconies and courtyards.\n    But still they face formidable difficulties. Many rural\nfactories are unable to get the raw materials they need, or\nelse they find they have become too expensive.\n    Gao Jianming, an official of Zhejiang's Rural Industry\ndepartment, said Zhejiang firms scour China for raw materials,\nwhich sometimes they barter for finished goods.\n    The People's Daily this month reported about 60 pct of\nChina's rural factories operate below capacity because of power\nshortages. It said many rural factories lose money because of\nthese problems and difficulties in getting credit, poor quality\nof goods and competition from larger state firms.\n    \"Electricity is short. In the busiest periods on the farms\nthe factories work three to four days a week so that\nagriculture can have all the power it needs. But more power is\navailable at night or on Sundays,\" Gao said.\n    Rural factories mostly operate outside official plans,\nwhich allocate raw materials under quota at cheap prices to\nstate firms. They have to compete on the open market for raw\nmaterials whose prices are driven up by demand.\n    Li said Hongshan does not suffer from power shortages only\nbecause its cement factory provides cheap cement to the\nelectricity supply department.\n    The raw materials of Hongshan's cement have to come\nhundreds of miles from central China by rail or canal, while\nits textile factories buy fabric from the far northeast.\n    The industrialisation of rural China began in the late\n1970s, a key part of top leader Deng Xiaoping's economic\nreforms. Deng wanted to harness the manpower of the\ncountryside, but keep it there and not draw it to the cities.\n    Hongshan set up factories and businesses because there was\nnot enough work on the land for its 3,700 people. Now just 120\nof its workers work full-time on the land. The rest work in 23\nfactories making cement, plastics and textiles.\n    The transformation of the rural economy is most noticeable\nalong the eastern seaboard where communications are good,\nlabour plentiful, land fertile and large markets nearby.\n    Gao said rural factories in Zhejiang now employ 25 pct of\nthe province's labour force. In 1985 such factories, for the\nfirst time, produced more in value than the province's farms.\n    \"The industrialising process is not over. When our farms are\nmore mechanised, and not many are now, more labour will become\navailable. There is a very big potential,\" Gao said.\n    Rural industry in Zhejiang has grown by more than 20 pct a\nyear since 1980, faster than any other sector of the economy.\n    Goods from Hongshan's factories are sold all over China.\n    Villager Li said when Hongshan started building factories\nin 1975 it was illegal, but local leaders approved it on\ncondition no state money was invested.\n    \"We borrowed money to start our cement factory and have\nrelied on our own resources since then,\" he said.\n    Another worker in a Hongshan tea-growing collective said\nbefore rural industrialisation there was no point in working\nhard, because most people earned the same.\n    \"The laziest in the commune used to laugh at those of us who\nworked more, but got the same,\" she said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He said it was signed by an official Indian trade\ndelegation and Japanese businessmen in Tokyo last week.\n    The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreed\nnot to reduce ore imports from India although Japan's total\niron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because of\nthe recession in the Japanese steel industry.\n    He said Japanese ore imports in calendar 1987 would total\n96 mln tonnes, compared with 103.5 mln in 1986.\n    Government officials said India's total ore exports are\nlikely to rise to between 33 and 34 mln tonnes in 1987/88,\nagainst a provisionally estimated 31 mln in 1986/87.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has\nconfirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments of\nprincipal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debt\nrestructuring package.\n    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers as\nsaying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.\n    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepayment\naspect of the restructuring.\n    \"They are public documents and there is nothing secret about\nit,\" he told Reuters.\n    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretched\nrepayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with a\nseven and a half year grace period and an interest rate margin\nof 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.\n    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of \"seven different\nscenarios\" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.\n    \"It was one of the many options we offered the banks in\norder to win an attractive pricing,\" he said.\n    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signed\nin 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principal\nrepayments were not due until 1990.\n    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect the\nPhilippines' balance of payments position.\n    \"There is no problem in financing it -- the prepayments\nconstitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of\n2.5 billion dlrs,\" he said.\n    \"We do plan to cover the costs by selling Philippine\nInvestment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year.\"\n    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominated\ninstruments that will be offered to creditor banks and are\ndesigned for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved\nequity investments within the Philippines.\n    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs a\nyear when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.\n    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of the\naccord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expected\ndocumentation and agreement from all of them by July.\n    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largest\ninterest rate cut among major debtor nations.\n    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a\n1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila's\nnew pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentage\npoints.\n    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point drop\nfrom the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, the\nbankers said.\n    \"Add to this the fact that Manila has frozen principal\nrepayents since 1983, while Venezuela has amortised six billion\ndlrs in foreign debt since 1984 and will have paid back more\nthan eight billion dlrs by the end of this year,\" one added.\n    Ongpin said Manila's 7/8 margin meant the Philippines would\npay about 100 mln dlrs a year in interest when its grace period\nended.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japanese investors are reluctant to buy\nWest German stocks, now considered one of the most attractive\nbuys around after having taken a beating for the past two\nyears, investment managers said.\n    Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world's\nlargest in capitalisation, wealthy Japanese institutions view\nit as too small. They also worry about venturing into a market\nfrom which British investors have recently bailed out, they\nsaid.\n    \"There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount of\nbuying Japanese want to do,\" one West German investment manager\nsaid. There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable to\nliquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a sudden\ndownturn, he added.\n    \"Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is also\nlimited,\" another investment manager said. \"They know the blue\nchips, but there are too many other names they don't know.\"\n    The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has also\ndeterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad,\ninvestment managers said.\n    Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buy\ninto unsure overseas markets while the market at home continues\nto advance, said Seiji Yamamoto, senior manager at Dresdner ABD\nSecurities Ltd's Tokyo branch.\n    If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possible\nfrom the Tokyo market, they could face difficulty explaining\ntheir funds' performance, he added.\n    The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since the\nbeginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investors\nto turn away, one investment manager said.\n    The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slow\ncorporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollar\nand a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just before\nthe London market's liberalisation last year, the investment\nmanager said. \"Right now Japanese investors are taking a\nwait-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remains\nunfavourable,\" he said.\n    Although there has been some nibbling of West German\nstocks, particularly last week, most of the buys were for\nshort-term trades rather than long-term investments, an\ninvestment advisor at a West German firm said.\n    Investment managers believe, however, that genuine interest\nin West German stocks could develop within the next three to\nsix months.\n    Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and the\nLondon markets over the Frankfurt market but they are\ninterested in diversifying some of their funds, they said.\n    Some managers have been travelling in Europe, looking for\nnew opportunities, and are unlikely to ignore West German\nstocks, especially with the average price/earnings ratio at\nabout 11, they said.\n    The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the U.S. And\nLondon markets and 52 for the Japanese market, Guenter\nKirchhain, first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said.\n    \"This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormous\nalignment potential,\" he said. The West German market could\nreasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16,\nhe added.\n    Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as many\ninstitutions begin their new business years in April, he said.\n    However, one fund manager does not agree that new\ninvestment in West Germany will come that soon.\n    \"Japanese do not buy into a market with declining\nfundamentals,\" he said. When West Germany's fundamental economic\nindicators appear to have bottomed out, that will be the\nturning point for their investments, he added.\n    Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see the\ninvestment trends set by U.S. And British investors in the West\nGerman market.\n    \"They are waiting for someone to make the first move,\" he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and\nelectronic goods may upset West European officials, but they\ngenerally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest\ntrade row between the United States and Japan.\n    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,\nas it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade\npractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.\n    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit\nwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese\ntrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.\n    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting\nwith the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.\n    \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the\nU.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy\nResearch Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty\nmuch the same.\"\n    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or\nthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of\nthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,\nEuropeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.\n    \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he\nadded. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of\nfree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that\nliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\"\n    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's\ntendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import\ntax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.\n    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to\nbe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.\n    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has\nthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic\ngoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has\nfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.\n    But the European Community has challenged the agreement as\na violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\npractices that discriminates against its microchip producers.\n    \"It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of\nthe United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf.\n    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough\nline on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest\nof Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take\nthe lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.\n    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told\nReuters there has been no change in the Community's position\nsince a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a\nstrong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.\n    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign\nministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and\nappealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.\n    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after\nthe talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.\n    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no\nsigns of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging\nsanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a\ntrade war, they said.\n    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in\nEuropean trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,\ncosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to\ntry to improve the situation, the diplomats said.\n    In Britain, where the government is angered over the\ndifficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has\nfaced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said\nlast week that retaliatory action is being considered.\n    But government officials said last night, \"We are not\ntalking about days or weeks. This is going to take time.\"\n    They said the government would consider its options at a\ncabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions\nwere expected. The main thing the British would threaten the\nJapan with is denial of access to London's booming financial\nmarkets, government officials said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Today's liberalised financial markets are\nmaking it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities\nto prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have\nseveral options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan\nsources said.\n    A senior central bank official said that such methods as\ncontrolling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap\nagreements with other central banks, which have not been\ninvoked since 1978, are all being considered.\n    \"But the time may not be ripe,\" he said.\n    \"In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost\nimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\"\nsaid another senior bank official.\n    But the first official said: \"From a technical viewpoint,\nthe Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately\nafter other central banks involved agreed to do so.\"\n    A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two\nnations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the\nother's currency in case of need.\n    \"If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce\nthe decision jointly,\" said the first official.\n    The sources said they believed the limit of currency market\nintervention may be being reached after they saw recent\nconcerted market action by central banks of major industrial\nnations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the\nbattered dollar.\n    But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further\neasing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an\nofficial discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they\nsaid.\n    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled\nout another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.\n    One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of\nthe Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the\nU.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue\nintervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run\nout of their yen cash positions.\n    \"But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,\"\nhe said.\n    The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200\nbillion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,\naccording to the sources.\n    Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two\nbillion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the\ndollar in New York last week.\n    The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other\ncurrency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find\nit necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each\nother towards that end.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "China's economic reforms will take\ndecades to fulfill and will outlast the life of any leader\nbecause they are the only way to save the country from poverty,\nan economist in one of the country's top think tanks told\nReuters.\n    But He Weiling, Washington representative of the China\nEconomic System Reform Institute, said China's economic reforms\ndefinitely are not at risk from the nationwide drive since\nJanuary against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western\npolitical ideas.\n    He said \"bourgeois liberalism\" is not affecting departments\ndealing with economics.\n    His is one of a small number of key institutes, set up in\nthe early 1980s, which formulate economic reform policies and\nadvise the top leadership on them.\n    Discussing subjects raised in the budget speech last week,\nwhich put the 1986 and 1987 deficits at more than 15 billion\nyuan because of excessive consumer demand and capital\nconstruction plus falling efficiency in state firms, He said\nreform of state firms and the financial system is the key goal\nfor 1987.\n    \"The most difficult thing is to strike the balance between\nmaking them independent units and the need for central control,\"\nHe said.\n    \"We are exploring ways of doing this, through joint stock\nownership, leasing, factory management responsibility systems\nor in other ways,\" he added.\n    One of the most serious problems facing China's leaders is\nhow to curb excess investment in capital construction,\nespecially in projects outside the state plan.\n    He said this problem is chronic in all socialist economies.\n    This is because firms are judged on output, not\nprofitability or efficiency.\n    \"Firms use every excuse to get money and materials. They say\nthey want money to build offices but in fact use it to build\napartments, which is unauthorised,\" He said.\n    \"Also, it is not good to report profits, which would mean\nhigher tax payments. It is better to report a loss,\" he added.\n    He said China's state firms are continuing a 5,000-year-old\ntradition when they under-report their assets in order to\nreduce claims on them by higher authority.\n    He said China will have to improve auditing, economic\nregulations and the tax system, which he described as \"chaotic,\"\nespecially at the lower levels, in order to deal with\nunder-reporting.\n    \"Another important step is to further develop the money\nmarkets to give firms an opportunity to invest. They need\nchannels for this which they do not have now. Without this,\nthere will be no genuine supply and demand for money,\" he said.\n    As a reform to encourage efficiency, China now supplies\nstate firms with loans instead of grants as in the past.\n    But He said the reforms have not resulted in much real\nchange because the loans carry low-interest. \"So some efficient\nfirms have not been able to get money from banks.\"\n    Price reform has been one of the most sensitive aspects of\nthe reform programme. Widespread discontent over price rises\nforced the government to promise in January that there will be\nno major increases in 1987.\n    He said the price of steel, timber and cement and other\nindustrial raw materials only will \"rise gradually\" this year.\n    Large-scale price adjustments would have an adverse\npsychological impact and create social discontent.\n    \"We must preserve unity and popular support,\" he said, but\n\"sometimes, the common people must make a sacrifice, like those\nof Germany and Japan after 1945.\"\n    He said restrictions on a wide range of prices, including\nmost farm and light industrial products, have been lifted and\nmany intermediate pricing schemes scrapped over the last eight\nyears.\n    \"It will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete an\noverhaul of the price system. We must move carefully. We have\nno model to work from and have only ourselves to rely on,\" He\nsaid.\n    He said the greatest fear expressed by foreigners is that\nreform and open-door policies will not survive the death of\ncertain elderly leaders.\n    He did not name top leader Deng Xiaoping, 82, the chief\narchitect of both policies since 1979.\n    \"These fears are unfounded. The two policies have already\nbecome the basic national policy of China. The reforms are\nirreversible. China is one of the poorest 25 countries in the\nworld. Without the reforms, how are we to escape from this\npoverty?\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> has made a bold move in\nselling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and\nploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share\nanalysts said.\n    \"It sounds like a good deal,\" Stuart McKibbin of <A.C. Goode\nand Co> told Reuters.\n    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas\ninterests held in the <Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead\nsell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and\nProduction Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.\n    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest\nsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it\ndoes not already hold in <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.\n    \"This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the\nimpression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,\"\nMcKibbin said.\n    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and\n300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given\nitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on\nan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing\ndivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.\n    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right\nto share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an\noil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.\n    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers\nyielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.\nAnalysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs\nfor every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.\n    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker <Bain and Co Ltd>\nsaid the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry\nwas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of\nAustralian-owned assets to a foreign company.\n    \"The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold\nback to the Americans,\" Goldston-Morris said.\n    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the\nlargest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry\nand would give it access to some of the best sugar properties\nand mills in the country, analysts said.\n    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend\nacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the\nbottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.\n    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next\nseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.\n    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging\ninvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's\noverall performance, analysts said.\n    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on\nwhat had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely\nfrom U.S. Dollar debt, they said.\n    \"It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely\nwith debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil\nprice collapsed on them,\" Owen Evans of Sydney broker <Meares\nand Philips Ltd> said.\n    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also\ngained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses\naccumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.\n    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake\nin Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50\nBass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd\n<BRKN.S>.\n    \"Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland\nBasin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately\nand Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,\"\nGoldston-Morris said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Taiwan is planning to significantly\nrelax foreign exchange controls within the next few months, but\nthere is little prospect of a sudden outflow of capital,\nbankers and economists polled by Reuters said.\n    They said a statement by Premier Yu Kuo-Hua last Friday\nthat Taiwan might suspend the controls indicated the government\nwas ready to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals to hold and\ninvest foreign currency for the first time.\n    \"There has been a major shift in government policy,\" said\nLiang Kuo-Shu, chairman of the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.\n    Yu said foreign exchange controls, under which all foreign\ncurrency must be converted into Taiwan dollars, might be\nsuspended if Taiwan's trade surplus grows too large. He said\ncontrols could be retained for use in an emergency.\n    Yu said the aim was to reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange\nreserves and ease pressure on the money supply.\n    The reserves have grown to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs,\ncompared with about 26 billion in late March last year, due to\nTaiwan's widening trade surplus. The surplus hit a record 15.6\nbillion dlrs last year against 10.6 billion in 1985.\n    Approximately 95 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.\n    The surplus in the first two months of this year rose to\n2.73 billion dlrs from 2.02 billion in the same 1986 period.\n    Money supply grew by a seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in the\nyear to end-february.\n    Bankers and economists said they did not believe the\ngovernment intended to drop all foreign exchange controls and\nallow the Taiwan dollar to be freely traded.\n    But they said over the next few months certain restrictions\nwill probably be eased to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals\nto hold part of their foreign exchange earnings for overseas\ninvestment.\n    Bankers and economists also said it was likely the\ngovernment would lift a ban on investment in foreign stocks.\nThey said it was uncertain, however, whether investment would\nbe direct or channeled through government-approved funds.\n    Taiwan allowed firms and individuals to invest in overseas\ngovernment bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit\nfor the first time last year.\n    Bankers said Yu's statment was an indication the government\nis becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of\ninflation posed by the growing foreign exchange reserves.\n    Inflation is now running at about three pct.\n    Mounting reserves are also seen as giving Washington\nleverage in its efforts to force Taiwan to boost the value of\nits currency to reduce the trade imbalance.\n    Bankers said dropping foreign exchange restrictions was\nunlikely to lead to significant capital outflows because of the\nrising value of the Taiwan dollar.\n    \"All the signs are that capital would move in,\" said John\nBrinsden, manager of Standard Chartered Bank in Taipei.\n    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 16 pct against the\nU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened today at 34.26\nagainst the American currency.\n    Most economists believe the Taiwan dollar will continue to\nrise this year on strong U.S. Pressure for appreciation.\n    Economists estimate up to five billion U.S. Dlrs of\nspeculative money flowed into Taiwan last year.\n    Yu's statement surprised most local and foreign bankers,\nwho regard the former central bank governor as a fiscal\narch-conservative. They said it shows Taiwan is determined to\ngo ahead with wide-ranging financial liberalisation.\n    \"It's more than a straw in the wind,\" said Brinsden. \"It\nindicates that something dramatic will happen.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Tokyo stock market is likely to\nrecover from its recent nervousness, caused by the rise of the\nyen and the threat of a trade war with the U.S., And resume its\nupward climb, brokers polled by Reuters said.\n    President Reagan's threat to impose tariffs on Japanese\nelectronics exports because of Japan's alleged refusal to abide\nby a bilateral agreement on computer chips, was unlikely to\ncause the market to crash, the brokers said on the eve of the\nnew fiscal year starting April 1.\n    The market today fell 60.91 points to 21,566.66.\n    Most brokers said Tokyo stocks should rise 10 to 15 pct in\nthe coming fiscal year, provided the yen does not rise too far\nagainst the dollar and U.S. Sanctions do not escalate into an\nall-out trade war.\n    \"The market will continue to rise in the new fiscal year, so\nlong as we can avoid a free-fall in the dollar against the yen,\"\nNikko Securities' top analyst Kasuhiza Okamoto said.\n    However, brokers said the market was unlikely to perform\nbetter than it has in the past year.\n    \"It will be very difficult to repeat last year's\nperformance. Last year was a bumper year that will live in the\nannals of the market,\" said Kleinwort and Benson Ltd's\nsecurities analyst, Peter Tasker.\n    The market rose 37 pct in the fiscal year just ending.\n    Tasker said Japan's discount rate, which was cut five times\nthis past fiscal year, was so low that it forced funds from\nbank accounts into stocks, buoying the market.\n    Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the coming\nyear the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twice\nand the inflow of funds would be slower.\n    Brokers said their optimism about the market was based on\nthe current low interest rates, the increasing propensity of\nthe Japanese to save as the economy stagnates, the imminent\nintroduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post office\nsavings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks.\n    They said Japanese with money to spare, and companies\nunwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the present\nclimate of stagnant growth, would keep on snapping up stocks.\n    \"You just have to jump on the back of the winners and jump\noff quick if they start to lose,\" one broker said.\n    Currently the Japanese discount rate is 2.5 pct.\n    Brokers predicted that among this year's winners would be\nshares which will benefit from domestic expansion.\n    Other winners would be stocks related to the fight against\nAIDS, financial stocks in general, food shares likely to gain\nfrom a government-initiated agricultural deregulation\nprogramme, and issues supported by Japan's increased defense\nspending budget.\n    \"The themes this year are very clear,\" said Nikko Securities'\nOkamoto. He said Japan had to respond to international pressure\nto stimulate its domestic demand, buy more imports and\nestablish itself as a supply base of capital.\n    Brokers said banks and other financial institutions would\nbe among the most popular shares this year.\n    \"We will have to consolidate our position as the capital\nsupply base to the world,\" said Okamoto, noting Japan is the\nworld's largest creditor nation.\n    Brokers said they expect the government this year to permit\nJapanese banks to start full-scale equity brokerage overseas.\nThey also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan.\n    Brokers said they expect subsidies to Japan's farmers to be\nslashed this year, cutting the price of food. Beneficiaries of\nsuch a move would include food processors and suppliers.\n    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has set the expansion of\ndomestic demand as a top priority this year, and brokers said\nthey envisaged higher profits for real estate and construction\ncompanies, as well as many domestic manufacturers.\n    Brokers denied a suggestion that the market might be\nover-extended because the amount now invested, 334,000 billion\nyen, was about the same as Japan's gross national product.\n    Barclays De Zoette and Wedd financial analyst, Peter\nMorgan, said the 20 pct tax on post office and bank deposits\ndue to be levied this autumn would channel at least 2,000\nbillion more yen into the stock market.\n    Brokers said they believe there would be more reports in\nthe coming year of scientific discoveries to combat or diagnose\nAquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and these would\npropel related companies' shares even higher than they had\nrisen already.\n    \"AIDS stories suck individuals' money into the market.\nJapanese people are paranoid about AIDS,\" said one broker.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Consuming countries, chastened by the\ncollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support\noperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that\ncommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are\nserving, a Reuter survey showed.\n    They want price ranges to be more responsive to market\ntrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the\naccords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid\nthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.\nConsumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,\nhave also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.\n    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a\ngeneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation and\nprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey\nshowed.\n    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set\nprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do\nunder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase\nlimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\nand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\ntotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\nwill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\nworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\n    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\nStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\n    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\nadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting\ncountries agreed several changes to make the reference price\nmore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions\nunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance\noperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund\nbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature\nof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running\ninto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.\n    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations\nin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that\nagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.\n    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that\n\"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota\nshares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of\nBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain\nits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,\nalthough an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,\ndelegates and trade sources see chances of any near term\nnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.\n    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These\ndo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for\ndiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collect\nstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said\ndifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up any\nprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer\ncompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glut\nmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.\n    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are\ninternational study groups, made up of governments with advice\nfrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.\n    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned\ndirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to\nbecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet\nUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the\nU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,\nciting the lack of widespread support.\n    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in\nKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity\npact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to\nstudy individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented\ncommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.\n    \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the\nprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\"\nofficial Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently\nbelongs to only two international commodity agreements that\nhave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement\n(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat\npacts.\n    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement\nbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and\nnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,\nthe State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA\nas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.\n    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members\nof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment\nmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect\nmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a market\noriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.\n    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have\nconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on\nthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister\nLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the\nworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its\nparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.\n    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing\nCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC\nlaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes\nfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from\n70,000.\n    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and\ndelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told\nReuters in London, \"Agreements with economic clauses to\nstabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were\nclose to market reality, if there was full participation by\nproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to\ntake their obligations in the framework of the agreement\nseriously.\"\n    But Baron added, \"No real sanctions are available for a\ncountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German\napproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best\ninstrument to help developing countries. They were never meant\nto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how\ndeveloping countries often interpret them.\"\n    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of\ncommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third\nWorld producing countries. But recently demands for more\nstringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\nneed for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\ngrown.\n    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\na two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\n    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\nmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\nof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\nborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\nDelegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\nreflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\nthan dictate what prices should be.\n    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\nrealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\n    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\nto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\nsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\nmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.\n    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\nReuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\nproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are\nstructural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\nagreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\nMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\ncannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\nagreements.\n    \"The political will is not there on the part of some\nconsumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\n    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\nForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\nagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\nreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system\nof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact\nand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham\nShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings\nenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean\ngreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leading domestic semiconductor makers\nwill boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips\nfrom next month in line with government attempts to ward off\nU.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.\n    The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the\nsanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of the\nplans, analysts said.\n    The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of\nproducts and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to\nhonour a semiconductor trade pact.\n    In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagan\nsaid Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory\npricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.\n    But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said\nyesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop\nthe tariffs if Japan shows a \"clear indication\" that it will open\nits markets to U.S. Goods.\n    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has\nurged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the\nsecond quarter, following a call to reduce production by more\nthan 20 pct the previous quarter.\n    MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.\n    Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to\ncancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime\nMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.\n    \"The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its sword\nand shown that it can and will do business,\" said analyst Nick\nEdwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.\n    But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can\ncut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal of\nthe sanctions -- is more difficult.\n    \"The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's\n(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer\nproducts. They're well supplied here,\" said Richard May, senior\nanalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.\n    The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,\nbut Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end\nproduction skills, the analysts said.\n    \"The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on\nsemiconductors in return for free access to other areas,\" said\nEdwards.\n    A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T>, said the firm's\nreduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory\n(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the\ntrade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result of\nthe company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.\n    Company officials unveiled the following plans -\n    - NEC Corp <NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans to\nslash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to\nsix mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last\nquarter.\n     In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chip\nimports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip\nconsumption the year before.\n    - Hitachi Ltd's <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's will\nfall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. The\ncompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific\ntarget. Imports are currently very low.\n    - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM\nproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is\nconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said.\n    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell\nthe U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a\njoint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern\nJapan.\n    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second\nquarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln\nchips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased\nimports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult\nas it depends on sales demand.\"\n    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with\nMITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.\n    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April\nproduction by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying ways\nto increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning\nApril 1 from the previous year's total of more than five\nbillion yen, a company official said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Reserves have increased every year\nsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.\n    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,\ndown from 118 mln in 1985.\n    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.\n    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in\noil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,\nwhich had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln\nstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for\nlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.\n    The company said had very few exploration wells committed\nfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its\nexploration program. Even without further success, the existing\nfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to\nprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.\n    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "One or two large West German banks\neffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at\nthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from\ntheir overnight deposits, money dealers said.\n    As a result, call money soared in active trading to around\nthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as\nbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.\n    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily\n51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the\ncentral bank over the first 29 days of the month.\n    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7\nbillion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.\n    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise\nholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and\ntomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because\nbanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of\nTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for\nthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.\n    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,\nflowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return\nuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.\n    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,\ncommanded short-term money requirements of as much as five\nbillion marks or so.\n    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the\nmonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,\ndraining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought\nfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess\nfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.\n    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced\nknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its\nsales of treasury bills on Friday.\n    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total\nminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank\nhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate\nthe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.\n    \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not\nselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this\namount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the\nmarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will\nbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\"\n    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in\nrates, given the delicate state of currency markets.\n    International central banks have been at pains to prevent a\ndollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.\nDealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer\nundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.\n    \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between\nthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today\ncannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said.\n    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average\nrates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or\nfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned\nwithout the excessive draining through the treasury bill\nmechanism.\n    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations\nbetween Germany's major employers and the unions, the\nBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to\nmonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.\n    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the\nLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion\nmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Forest\nProducts Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's <Amcor Ltd>.\n    He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the\n24 pct of NZFP held by Rada. He said the FCL offer was better\nthan Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP\nshareholders, but he gave no further details.\n    Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their\npulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were\nincreasing their existing cross-shareholdings.\n    The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in\nAmcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada's\nNZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek\nstatutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.\n    Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from <Wattie\nIndustries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the price\nto be paid by Amcor.\n    FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last\nyear with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share,\nvaluing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at\n3.88 dlrs today.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has\nconfirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments of\nprincipal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debt\nrestructuring package.\n    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers as\nsaying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.\n    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepayment\naspect of the restructuring.\n    \"They are public documents and there is nothing secret about\nit,\" he told Reuters.\n    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretched\nrepayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with a\nseven and a half year grace period and an interest rate margin\nof 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.\n    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of \"seven different\nscenarios\" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.\n    \"It was one of the many options we offered the banks in\norder to win an attractive pricing,\" he said.\n    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signed\nin 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principal\nrepayments were not due until 1990.\n    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect the\nPhilippines' balance of payments position.\n    \"There is no problem in financing it -- the prepayments\nconstitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of\n2.5 billion dlrs,\" he said.\n    \"We do plan to cover the costs by selling Philippine\nInvestment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year.\"\n    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominated\ninstruments that will be offered to creditor banks and are\ndesigned for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved\nequity investments within the Philippines.\n    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs a\nyear when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.\n    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of the\naccord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expected\ndocumentation and agreement from all of them by July.\n    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largest\ninterest rate cut among major debtor nations.\n    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a\n1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila's\nnew pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentage\npoints.\n    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point drop\nfrom the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, the\nbankers said.\n    \"Add to this the fact that Manila has frozen principal\nrepayents since 1983, while Venezuela has amortised six billion\ndlrs in foreign debt since 1984 and will have paid back more\nthan eight billion dlrs by the end of this year,\" one added.\n    Ongpin said Manila's 7/8 margin meant the Philippines would\npay about 100 mln dlrs a year in interest when its grace period\nended.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The\ncompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter\nsaid had become one of Mannesmann's \"strategic aims.\"\n    He said the company's drive to combine activities in\nmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus\npoint\" for Mannesmann.\n    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take\na majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group\nfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall\nnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net\nprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.\n    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar\nand lack of demand for steel pipe.\n    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe\nwere bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added\nthe company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this\nyear.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Consumers\nand a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution\nof export shares using \"objective criteria,\" which would likely\nhave reduced Brazil's share.\n    Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota\nnegotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil\nwas willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal\nwas accepted would no longer be on the table.\n    \"As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million\nbags,\" he told Reuters.\n    Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African\nand Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by\nAngola, are also no longer valid, delegates said.\n    The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a\nbriefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent\nLatin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said.\n    There, the producers expressed their political will to\nnegotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the\ndamaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to\nagree quotas, Montes said.\n    The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock\nverification. They expected talks on stock verification to take\nup the remainder of today's session, delegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Aluminium capacity expansion planned for\nthe period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any\nacceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the\nscale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird\nAssociates' 1987 Aluminium Review.\n    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to\nbe around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln\ntonnes are scheduled, Bird said.\n    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and\nincreased imports by less developed countries.\n    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate\nby as much as general growth, but non-socialist world\nconsumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from\n13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird\nsaid.\n    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of\nchange after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed\nthis transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied\nwith the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have\nserved them well in recent years.\n    In order to encourage the construction of additional\nsmelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher\nlevel.\n    Production costs are likely to rise again in the years\nahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity\nsuppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,\naccording to the review.\n    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price\nscenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and\n89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.\n    Such a price development is not expected to cause any\nmarked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely\nrise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the\npipeline for steel and copper.\n    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,\nas the world economy has not responded well to the\nopportunities offered by cheap oil.\n    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4\npct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher\nin 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Deputies from three provinces\nsaid Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.\nOne said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pct\nof total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today.\n\"This is incompatible with the important place occupied by\nagriculture,\" he said.\n    Other deputies said the state had broken promises to\nimprove fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.\n    Although another congress member was quoted by the agency\nas saying Zhao's opening speech last week was \"discreet,\nappropriate, comprehensive and assuring,\" others said the\ngovernment had spent too much or too little. One member said\npeople were worried about the state's budget deficit, projected\nat more than two billion dlrs this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Institute for Economic Research\n(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross\ndomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct\nforecast made last December.\n    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw\nthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as\nthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision\ndue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.\n    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil\nproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's\nfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.\n    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this\nyear. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private\nconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct\nin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.\n    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2\npct last year due to the slack economic activity.\n    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit\nof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion\nsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's\ncentral bank, last month forecast the current account would be\nroughly in balance this year.\n    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have\nno notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the\nbudget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9\npct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Timing will be\nset to take account of the French privatisation program.\n   Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said the\nratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lower\nhouse) early next month before passing to the Senate (upper\nhouse) at the end of May.\n    Eurotunnel officials expect work on the sites to start in\nDecember or January.

If the lessor does not\nconsent, NL will pursue an alternative that will result in the\nseparation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.\n    NL said it believes the alternative form of the separation\nwould not require the lessor's consent, which would not be\nsought. The alternative would require approval by NL\nshareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, it\nsaid.\n    As previously announced, NL plans to distribute shares of\nNL Chemicals Inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemption\nof NL's Series C preferred stock depositary receipts, when the\nredemption is not likely to result in significant tax liability\nto either NL or NL Chemicals.\n    NL also said it may consider paying the redemption value of\nthe Series C preferred stock in cash instead of implementing\nthe spin-off or the alternative for separating the two\nbusinesses.\n    Under terms of the Series C preferred, NL at any time may\nredeem the stock for cash. At Feb 28, 1987, the redemption\nvalue was about 15 dlrs per depositary receipt, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Australia faces a major medium term\nadjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said\nin its latest annual review of the Australian economy.\n    It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4\npct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external\ndebt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and\ninflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD\ncountries.\n    A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis\nfor sustained non-inflationary growth and external\ncompetitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall\nhad sharply deteriorated since June 1985.\n    A major shift of real resources to the external sector --\nabout 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the\neconomy to expand in line with potential, for employment to\ngrow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.\n    Success depended on the setting of right policies including\ntighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector\nborrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.\n    Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected\neconomic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter\nfiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in\ntrade volumes.\n    It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,\nthe current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of\nGDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was\nprojected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by\nmid-1988.\n    Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain\nthe competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's\ndepreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in\norder to encourage business investment.\n    The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by\ndeveloping viable and competitive service and manufacturing\nindustries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to\ncorrect its external imbalances.\n    It added Australia should reduce protection levels in\nmanufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no\ndoubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House\nagriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has\nthreatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic\nsweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Exxon Corp said in its annual report\nthat it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace\nall oil and gas produced.\n    The company said that it added about four pct to production\nbringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based\nlargely on increased production of oil overseas but additions\nto its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions\ndid not replace all of the oil and gas produced.\n    The company said that the average price for oil and gas\ndeclined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38\npct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.\n    Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986\nfell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from\nthe Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from\noil sands in Canada.\n    Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for\nexpoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe\nand the Far East.\n    But capital expenditures for exploration and production\nwere cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year\nand further reductions were expected in 1987.\n    Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas\nliquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached\na new high of 422,000 bpd.\n    The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea\nfields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to\nsell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower\nquality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded\nover the past several years.\n    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon\nmore of a spread in its refinery operations and added to\nearnings gains from refining and marketing.\n    Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations\nrose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs\nin 1985.\n    The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043\nmln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs\nrose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.\n    Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500\nmln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery\ncompleted last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in\nRotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes\nto extract higher proportions of light products.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Questions would then be\npresented to China.\n    \"After China, other important state-trading countries\nincluding the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.\nChina's application could be considered a test case,\" he said.\n    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but\nothers among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.\n    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy\nentering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and\nthe expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy\nwithout trade discrimination, de Clercq added.\n    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese\neconomy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current\nSocialist GATT members.\n    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange\nshortage would force China to import less this year and next\nthan in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment\nand capital.\n    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and\ntoday signed an agreement to open a European Community\nCommission office in Peking.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Dutch Finance Ministry said it is\ndiscussing with foreign fiscal authorities, primarily West\nGerman and Belgian, possible means to combat evasion of tax on\ninterest payments received abroad.\n    Finance Minister Onno Ruding told parliament yesterday he\naimed in 1988 to recoup about 100 mln guilders in tax revenue\non interest income both at home and abroad, and a further 300\nmln by the end of 1990.\n    He expected Dutch banks soon to start automatically\nreporting interest payments they make, but this could prompt\nmore investors to open foreign accounts, Ruding said.\n    There are no restrictions on Dutch capital flows, and the\nministry was therefore seeking co-operation from fiscal\nauthorities abroad to monitor interest paid on accounts held by\nDutch citizens, said spokesman Jaap Weeda.\n    Ruding was largely motivated by guidelines laid down in the\ncentre-right government's policy plan which calls for the\nministry to boost its income by one billion guilders by 1990.\n    Weeda said it was difficult to estimate taxation lost\nthrough undeclared interest income, but Ministry figures\nindicated that about 20 pct of such income was not declared.\n    Ruding told parliament Dutch banks seemed willing to\nco-operate in plans to report on interest payments, but they\nforesaw practical problems.\n    There was no firm target date for introducing reporting\nprocedures, but Ruding was adamant it must happen soon.\n    \"I cannot and will not accept any delay,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The notes are part of a\nrefinancing plan that includes a new credit agreement with\ndomestic and foreign banks for 300 mln dlrs.\n    Proceeds from the new notes and bank facility will be used\nto terminate the company's current revolving credit facility by\nrepaying the approximate 400 mln dlr balance, it said.\n    A total of 620 mln dlrs was originally drawn down under the\nrevolving credit facility on April 29, 1986, when National\nGypsum was acquired by a management-led investors group in a\nleveraged buyout, the company said.\n    National Gypsum said that the new credit agreement will\nconvert in 1990 to a term loan that will be amortized over four\nyears.\n    It said the new notes will rank senior to the company's\nexisting 14-1/2 pct senior subordinated debentures of 2001 and\n15-1/2 pct discount debentures due 2004.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A plan by European producers to sell\n854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention\nstocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French\nsugar producer Beghin-Say, said.\n    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a\npossible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers\nto withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC\nexport licensing policies.\n    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to\ngive producers an equivalent price to that which they would get\nby offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.\n    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and\nthat producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer\nalready lodged with intervention boards of different European\ncountries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar\noffered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already\ncleared quality specifications.\n    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention\nstocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC\nregulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the\nsugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of\nsugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Stands in these fields were thin and\nchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.\n    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable\nand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which\nwould aid recovery.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Canadian Pacific Ltd's principal aim\nover the next few years will be to significantly increase the\ncompany's return on equity, it said in the annual report.\n    Canadian Pacific's return on average capital employed fell\nto 4.7 pct in 1986 from 5.9 pct in the prior year. Return on\naverage shareholders' equity declined to 2.5 pct from 4.8 pct\nin 1985.\n    \"To achieve this goal will require that the businesses\ncomprising Canadian Pacific are leaders in their respective\nfields,\" the company said in the report to shareholders.\n    \"Although the steps already taken to reposition and solidify\nCanadian Pacific point to a better financial performance in\n1987, more remains to be accomplished if the company is to\nproduce returns that meet shareholder expectations,\" it said.\n    Canadian Pacific previously reported 1986 operating net\nprofit fell to 150.1 mln dlrs from 252.7 mln dlrs in the prior\nyear. Revenues were 15.02 billion dlrs compared to 15.04\nbillion dlrs in 1985.\n    It said emphasis will continue on reducing dependence on\ncyclical industries and strengthening the asset mix.\n    Canadian Pacific said 1986 results were disappointing, but\nthe company took several steps towards reviewing assets and\noperations and rationalizing its asset base.\n    As previously reported, it sold its 52.5 pct interest in\nCominco Ltd <CLT> for 472 mln dlrs in October, 1986 and\nCanadian Pacific Airlines Ltd for 300 mln dlrs in January,\n1987.\n    Including other asset sales, Canadian Pacific's\nconsolidated assets fell to 17.70 billion dlrs at year end from\n21.3 billion dlrs at the end of 1985, it said.\n    The company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln\ndlrs in 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the\nyear.\n    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown\nrepresenting permanent impairment in asset values, partially\noffset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest in\nCominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'\nflight kitchens.\n    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of\n172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included in\nfirst quarter results.\n    Canadian Pacific said despite lower earnings and\nextraordinary charges, its overall cash position strengthened\nin 1986 as cash generated from operations and asset sales was\nmore than sufficient to finance capital expenditures of 1.80\nbillion dlrs.\n    Long term debt fell to 4.50 billion dlrs from 6.22 billion\ndlrs in 1985.\n    Consolidated 1987 capital spending will be reduced\nconsiderably from 1986 levels, mainly due to the Cominco and\nair line unit sales, it said. Spending commitments totalled 239\nmln dlrs at the end of 1986.\n\nThe company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln dlrs\nin 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the year.\n    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown\nrepresenting permanent impairment in asset values, partially\noffset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest in\nCominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'\nflight kitchens.\n    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of\n172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included in\nfirst quarter results.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Harrowing, as well as well-timed\napplications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Government figures show investment grew 10 pct last year\ncompared with a fall of three pct in 1985.\n    The plan foresees this leading to creation of 32,000 new\njobs a year.\n    The program also foresees government spending cuts,\nparticularly in the public sector, reducing the state budget\ndeficit to around five pct of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in\n1990 from nearly 11 pct in 1986.\n    Portugal's foreign debt, which totals more than 16 billion\ndlrs, was forecast to be reduced to the equivalent of 24 pct of\nGDP in 1990 from around 55 pct at end-1986.\n    Detailed forecasts were not released for beyond 1990.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.\n    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop\npredictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for\nplantations because of low returns on their investment.\n    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as\nfarmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the\npast six months coupled with low bean prices.\n    If such economies continue into the winter months both the\ntemporao and the developing October/April main crop could face\nserious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would\nnormally be treated against the disease.\n    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated\nincidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say\nthese are not yet significant.\n    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of\ntemporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the\nbulk will not appear until the last month, September.\n    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent\ncondition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will\nlead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

This compared with the\n1986 figure of 1.395 billion punts, 8.5 pct of GNP.\n    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry told parliament \"Conditions\nare extremely difficult and there is no room at all for soft\noptions.\" The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement was 1.85 billion\npunts, 10.7 pct of GNP, compared with 2.145 billion punts or\n13.0 pct of GNP last year.\n    MacSharry announced a wage freeze for Ireland's 187,000\ncivil servants and said all new civil service jobs had to be\napproved by him. Mortgage interest relief was cut, some housing\ngrants axed and social welfare and health costs trimmed. Income\ntax and excise duties were left unchanged.\n    Eager to stop the outflow of funds from Ireland, he said \"We\nmust do more to encourage non-residents, and especially\nexpatriates, to invest in the Irish economy.\"\n    Without giving details, he also said Ireland wished to\nprovide the right conditions and a favourable taxation climate\nfor developing the international fnnancial services sector.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreign\ncompanies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S.\nfirms.\n    \"If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfill\ntheir tax-paying responsibilities in that country, then\nforeigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing,\"\nWoodard said.\n    In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans who\nlive abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3\nbillion dlrs a year, Woodard said.\n    The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and\nactually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.\n    Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail to\nreport foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreign\noperations can underreport income, Woodard said.\n    The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100    \nexaminers to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase,\nwhich should lead to more tax return audits.\n    The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends or\npractices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance with\ntax laws, Woodard said.\n    The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, but\nWoodard denied it was because of the trade dispute over\nsemiconductors between the United States and Japan.\n    The agency next will turn its attention to the automobile,\ncomputer and motorcycle industries.\n    The IRS will also receive information on anyone who applies\nfor a U.S. passport or permanent residence in the United States\nto help indentify those who do not file returns.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac\nopened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on\nsuperpower arms control moves and trade issues.\n    French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was to\npresent France's concern that the United States might ignore\nEuropean security interests in any accord with Moscow on\nremoving medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.\n    But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not\nagree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give\nthe Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomats\nsaid.\n    France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles\nfrom Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in\nother weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,\nconventional forces and chemical weapons.\n    Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French position\nsaying: \"Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should\nmention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles.\"\n    Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a\ndispute between two leading research institutes over patent\nrights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.\n    In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur\nInstitute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, of\nBethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties from\nthe test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight\nagainst AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).\n    \"This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American\ncooperation, allowing France and the United States to join\ntheir efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of\nspeeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure,\" Reagan\nsaid at the signing ceremony. \n    He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80\nper cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.\n    The foundation would also raise private funds and would\ndonate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less\ndeveloped countries. \n    Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the\nUnited States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House\nEast Room, with Reagan describing France as \"America's oldest\nally in war and peace.\" \n    \"I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the\nsame ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangers\nwhich we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, new\ndiseases and drugs,\" Chirac replied.\n    But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on\nover the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a rise\nin protectionism in the U.S. Congress. \n    A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to\nsell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of\nlessening surplus stocks.\n    Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, first\nproposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,\nduring his two-day visit to Washington.\n    The U.S. official described the idea as a \"grain producers'\nOPEC\" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries -- and said it went against the Reagan\nadministration's desire to lessen government intervention in\ntrade.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Canada's airline industry, shaken up by\na recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for\ngovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive\nfor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.\n    \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\"\nsaid Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.\n\"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"\n    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr\ntakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but\ncash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week\nas Canadian Airlines International Ltd.\n    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the\n6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's\n50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine\npct.\n    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and\ncost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true\npotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four\ndecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific\nLtd.\n    They said CP Air's management style had been not much\ndifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because\nneither airline was held accountable to its owners.\n    \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these\ntwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither\nseemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.\n    \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very\nconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air\nCanada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.\n    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than\nprofits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of\nBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.\n    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated\nlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its\nlosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.\n    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this\nyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on\nrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more\nthan 2 billion dlrs.\n    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to\nthe public, the prospect of privatization at a time of\nincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more\nattention to finances, analysts said.\n    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in\nexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit\nrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact that\nall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.\n    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,\nattracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in\nVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.\n    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air\ntraffic growth, and they expect profits will come from\ncost-cutting and careful spending.\n    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said\ninstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their\nportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new\ncompetition makes profit growth less certain.\n    \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At\none time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody\nelse's,\" Friend said.\n    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline\nshares for at least a year.\n    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a\npublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes\nwithout setting off a political storm.\n    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary\nupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.\n    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,\nalready has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of\na dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.\n    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered\nsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would\nsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the\nBoeing Co.\n    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,\nneeds to make fewer replacements and can afford these without\nhurting profits.\n    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian\nAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8\nmln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Tonight's American Petroleum Institute\nweekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns\nin distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,\nanalysts and traders said.\n    They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln\nbarrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3\nand four mln barrels.\n    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six\nmln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5\nmln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from\nthe previous week or slightly higher or lower.\n    For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks\nfell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for\nthe week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between\n700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance\ngasoline stocks will be unchanged.\n    API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the\nweek ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a\nsimilar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock\nlevels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.\n    The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal\nfactors but they said crude direction is harder to call.\n    Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended\nMarch 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between\n3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended\nMarch 27.\n    API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up\nthree pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said\nutilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by\nless than one pct for the week ended March 27.\n    Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market\nslightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already\npartially reflected in today's gains, they added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A. William Reynolds, chairman and\nchief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to\nannounce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile\ntender within a week.\n    Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the\ntender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the\ngroup sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate\nGenCorp while \"we have had only 10 days to respond.\"\n    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal\nchallenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York\nCity market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.\n    Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain\nof 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to\nsell the station to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.\n    Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were\ndropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has\nalready approved the station's sale.\n    Money from the sale of the station will play a role in\nhelping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored\nby AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds\nsaid. He provided no other details.\n    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief\nfinancial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,\nwhich was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About\n300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.\n    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the\nmeeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.\n    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members\nhave been telling him \"Bill, just don't pay greenmail\" to end\nthe takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority\nshareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds\nsaid he considers it a \"repugnant device.\"\n    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.\nMario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a\nlarge block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.\nGabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to \"stiffen\nthe backbone of the board to discourage greenmail.\"\n    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they\nare open to negotiations with GenCorp.\n    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the\nevent of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted\n\"we're developing alternatives that would not result in a\nchange in control.\"\n    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any\nproposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, \"We\nknow the company, we know the values and we know the\nopportunities better than any outside group.\"\n    In response to a question about whether any units are up\nfor sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The threatened trade war between the\nUnited States and Japan is just the kind of shock that\neconomists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.\n    But they are not so sure if that would be a brief\ncorrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices\nmark the start of a \"bear\" market.\n    \"It's the billion dollar question,\" said Richard O'Brien,\neconomist at American Express International Bank in London.\n    Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has\npoured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded\na good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of\nany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the\nJapanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the\ndollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it\nfall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of\nimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or\nbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,\nmay be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget\ndeficit.\n   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will\nhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the\ngap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.\nBonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The\nsubsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls\non the world stock markets.\n    \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\"\nsaid O'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\"\n    Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming\neconomy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in\nthe industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and\nhuge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.\n    Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith\nBarney Harris Upham said  \"We're still in a bull market,\" adding\nthat corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The\nbear usually strikes slowly.\"\n    Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in\nLondon, said the huge sums of money going through the world\nfinancial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.\n    Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in\nnon-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very\ndifficult to see where else they can put their money than in\nU.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,\naccording to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi\nSecurities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.\n    He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now\nto the French franc and West German mark.\n    In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and\nthe dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously\nresist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the\nMidwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,\neither from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.\n    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF\nthrough a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's\nstock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.\n    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will\nstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can\nadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.\n    \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)\nJacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is\nnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want\nto remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.\n    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation\nfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,\nMinstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln\nBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by\n9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.\n    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no\nsteps toward a transaction.\n    \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for\nthe last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate\nbattles I've seen,\" said one analyst.\n    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of\nbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current market\nprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they\nthink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.\n    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on\nits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.\n    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up\nwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials\ncompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an\nunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited\nfrom that company's restructuring.\n    \"Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate\noffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of\nbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a\n46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I\npersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per\nshare,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.\n    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a\nrestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and\nRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James\nGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and\ncarried out a wider share repurchase.\n    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is\nseeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the\ncompany at a premium.\n    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with\nfinancing the transaction.\n    Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel\nBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner\ntakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender\noffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner\nboard and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the\ntender offer and merger.\n    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a\nmerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees\nsince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,\nbelieve Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay\ndebt from the transaction.\n    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.\n   \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the\nlevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values\nsubstantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.\n    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the\ncompany's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's\ncurrent holdings.\n    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,\nwhich makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.\nAnalysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.\n    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office\nequipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S.\nand is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\"\nRose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> and\nMonsanto Corp <MTC>, he said.\n    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a\nprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo\nsecurity guards. It also has an information services business,\nand is trying to sell its financial services business.\n    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on\nrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,\nearned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per\nshare on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.\n    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln\nfrom its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a\nspecial union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union\nCarbide shares.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said Texaco\nhas made no realistic offers.\n    Earlier this year, a Texas court of appeals upheld\nPennzoil's claim against Texaco, ruling that Texaco unlawfully\ninterfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil.\nTexaco subsequently acquired Getty.\n    Liedtke said it has become more difficult to settle the\ncase because the courts continually rule in its favor, raising\nthe stakes of any agreement.\n    \"Each time this goes up (to a higher court), the\nexpectations of our shareholders goes up and it puts us in an\nincreasingly difficult positon,\" he said.\n    \"We cannot afford to settle this case for a pittance,\"\nLiedtke told the meeting of analysts.\n    \"We don't want to get sued for not fulfilling our fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\" he said.\n    Liedtke also said that the company would not settle for\nless than two billion dlrs, which has been suggested by a\nnumber of Wall Street analysts.\n    He did say, however, that Pennzoil would entertain any\nproposal from Texaco including a possible preferred stock\nposition in TExaco.\n    \"I won't assume we'll take it,\" he said. \"But we'd consider\nit.\" But he added that he thought it would be extremely\ndifficult to work out a settlement made up of stocks, bonds and\ncash.\n    Liedtke, who earlier said the company would have a lower\nfirst quarter, also told reporters that the company expected\nlower earnings this year.\n    \"We think earnings will probably be down this year,\" he\nsaid. Last year the company earned 1.28 dlrs a share from\ncontinuing operations or 68.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.9\nbillion dlrs.\n    The earnings figure comes before an extraordinary loss of\n56 cts a share or 23.1 mln dlrs.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The annual meeting is scheduled for\nApril 30 in Dallas, he said. Hemminghaus was in San Antonio for\nthe National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.\n    An effort by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens to take over\nDiamond Shamrock was a reason behind the company's decision to\nspinoff, although a spinoff may have occurred anyway,\nHemminghaus said.\n    He said that investment advisors told the company Pickens'\noffer was inadequate and suggested the company split up into a\npure exploration and production upstream operation and a pure\nplay downstream refining and marketing company.\n    He said he is hopes to raise 400 mln dlrs in financing for\nthe new company.\n    Hemminghaus said 65 to 75 pct of the new company's earnings\nwill come from wholesale refining, 20 to 30 pct will come from\nthe retail sale of gasoline and other items at gasoline\nconvenience store locations, and five to 10 pct from natural\ngas liquids and storage and marketing.\n    \"Growth will be defined in building retail volumes, jobber\nvolumes and refining capacity after that,\" Hemminghaus told\nReuters. He said the new company will have a capital spending\nbudget of 35 to 55 mln dlrs a year.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Neither unit may be restarted without the\ncommission's approval, the regulatory body said.\n    The NRC said it received information on March 24 that\ncontrol room operators at Peach Bottom had been observed\nsleeping while on duty in the control room.\n    It said the information indicated this conduct was\npervasive and has been occurring for some time, and that shift\nsupervision had knowledge of this situation.\n    In response to this information, the regulators said, they\ninitiated 24-hour inspection coverage of the plant's control\nroom, which is ongoing.\n    To date, the NRC said, its inspection has established\noperations control room staff has at times during various\nshifts, particularly the 2300 to 0700 shift, slept or otherwise\nbeen inattentive to duties over the past five months.\n    The commission said it also found management either knew\nand condoned the sleeping and inattention, or should have known\nabout it, and either took no action or inadequate action to\ncorrect this situation.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "venezuela will shortly announce a new\nplan to allow private companies to repay their foreign debts\nwith equity and for public debt to be converted into private\nsector investments, cntral bank president hernan anzola said.\n    Anzola told a meeting of the banking association yesterday\nthe new plan, to be called exchange agreement no. 4, will be\nannounced in mid-april.\n    He said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaid\nprivate sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stock\nin the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to those\nalready in effect in other latin american nations, he said.\n    at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have already\ntaken place in venezuela. In 1984, a group of 17 U.S. Banks led\nby citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cervecera\nnacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.\n    Anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow for\nconversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelan\nprivate industry.\n    Holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able to\nexchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct of\ntheir nominal value, which could be turned into private\ninvestment in priority areas.\n    This, anzola said, would mean a reduction in the amount of\nthe public sector debt and an increase in foreign investment.\nHe stressed that the public sector debt bonds will not be\nexchanged for shares of stock in state-owned companies.\n    Anzola said exchange rates for these transactions will\ndepend the type of investment the creditor intends to make,\nwith export-oriented companies to be favored.\n    Venezuela issued a new plan in december for the repayment\nof 7.8 billion dlrs in private sector foreign debt. Under the\nscheme, debtors are able to buy dollars at the preferential\n7.50 bolivars rate, but must also pay a premium.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said there are no law enforcement\nofficials involved at this time.\n    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it\nwas the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in\ngross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax\nrate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Therese, Quebec, plant and has received 220\nmln dlrs in interest-free government loans for the project.\n    GM Canada said the Canadian and Quebec governments are each\nproviding a 110 mln dlr loan for the upgrading.\n    The company said much of the investment will be used to\nbuild a paint complex, which will make the plant competitive\nwith other GM plants in the U.S. and Canada.\n    The 450-mln-dlr investment includes the cost of retooling\nthe plant to assemble front-wheel drive Chevrolet Celebrity\ncars, which will be produced at Ste. Therese, beginning in May,\nGM Canada said.\n    \"With the new paint complex and tooling, our plant will be\nfully modernized to be world competitive,\" GM Canada president\nGeorge Peapples told a news conference.\n    He said construction will begin this year on the modern\nbase coat/clear coat paint complex, which will provide enhanced\ncolor standards and improved paint quality, he said.\n    The Canadian government said the modernization will\nguarantee continued long-term employment for about 3,500\nassembly line workers at the Ste. Therese plant and for about\n4,300 people employed in supply jobs in Ontario and Quebec.\n    \"Without our participation...we faced the prospect of\nlosing this plant,\" said Michel Cote, Canadian minister of\nregional industrial expansion.\n    Cote said he expected 3,100 new supplier jobs will be\ncreated by the increased production in Ste. Therese.\n    The project will transfer the company's front-wheel drive\n\"A\" car production to Ste. Therese from Oshawa, Ontario and\nwill not increase the Ste Therese plant's capacity, GM Canada\nsaid.\n    It said it has produced 2.5 mln vehicles at the Ste.\nTherese plant since 1965.\n    The paint plant is expected to cost 200 to 250 mln dlrs and\nbegin operation in two years, Peapples told reporters after the\nannouncement.\n    The retooling included in the project had been announced in\nDecember but the company had not put a value on the retooling\ncosts, he said.\n    Peapples estimated the interest-free loans could save GM\nCanada about 60 mln dlrs at a 10 pct interest rate.\n    He said the loans are repayable in full in 30 years if GM\nkeeps the plant open. If the company closes the plant in the\n1990s, it will have to pay the federal and provincial\ngovernments a total 75 mln dlrs of the loan by 1991.\n    Peapples said GM Canada asked for the government loans\nbecause, due to an expected overcapacity in the auto industry\nin the 1990s, the company was not prepared to take the risks\ninvolved in the investment by itself.\n    GM Canada said the level of support offered by the\ngovernments is consistent with aid provided to auto assemblers\nin the U.S.\n    Peapples said the company expects very strong demand in the\nnext decade for the type of mid-size, front wheel drive car\nthat will be produced at Ste. Therese.\n    Cote added that GM Canada's 1985 sales of 18.5 billion dlrs\nrepresented four pct of Canada's gross domestic product.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He expects the company to\nearn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of\n1987.\n    In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial \"is\nactively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers\nlooking for a small life insurance company to acquire.\"\n    He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range\nand will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a\n\"wide spectrum of insurance services.\" No specific company has\nbeen targeted as yet, \"but I would like to make my first\nacquisition in 1987,\" he said.\n    He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy\ntakeover target.

They don't like GM,\" says Glantz.\n    General Motors might also be faced with wildcat strikes, or\nwalkouts by local union units that are not endorsed by the\nunion's central committee, analysts said.\n    General Motors will not comment on the talks, saying only\nit is seeking to become a \"world-class competitor.\"\n    Elements for a tough set of labor talks are in place.\n\"There is a lot of pressure on both sides. (General Motors\nchairman Roger) Smith is under pressure from stockholders. The\nunion is fighting to protect its members. Something has got to\ngive,\" Luckey says.\n    The consensus on Wall Street is that General Motors will be\nchosen as the \"strike target\", or the main company with which\nit will negotiate in the fall talks to decide the next\nthree-year national contract.\n    \"You get a feeling from talking with GM that they want to\nbe the strike target because (they feel) Ford might capitulate\ntoo easily,\" says Glantz.\n    The negotiations, expected to begin in late July, will\ndecide the major wage, benefit and job security issues that\nwill cover most U.S. autoworkers. The current contract expires\nSeptember 15.\n    Job security and \"outsourcing\", the  subcontracting of jobs\nto non-UAW labor, are expected to be the main issues.\n    \"You're going to see a rough set of negotiations,\nparticularly if they can't get the outsourcing issue decided,\"\nsays one former General Motors human relations executive.\n    Some analysts point out that if the UAW decides to focus on\nwages, it might pick Ford as the strike target because of\nFord's higher earnings last year.\n    \"You may see a situation where the UAW bargains with the\ntwo separately,\" breaking its historical pattern, says Luckey.\n    The number of cars building up in dealer showrooms might\nindicate General Motors is preparing for a confrontation with\nthe union, analysts say.\n    The company will have 95 days' supply of cars in dealer\nshowrooms at the end of March, Lucky estimates. Analysts say 50\nto 65-days' supply is normal.\n   General Motors wants to enter the negotiations \"with enough\ninventory that it won't feel a six-week strike,\" says Glantz.\n    Some in the industry say that, despite the closing of 11\nplants and indefinite layoff of 37,000 workers, further\nclosings and layoffs might be coming.\n    A General Motors spokesman says it is \"too early\" to know\nwhether plant closures will become an issue in the talks.\n    The former General Motors executive says more closures are\nlikely after a new UAW agreement is reached, but he adds,\n\"you're not going to see it before the contract,\" he says.\n    Lucky says 10 pct of General Motors's components plants are\non the \"red list\" of companies likely to be shut. \"It would\ntake a miracle for them to survive,\" he says.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Martin Marietta Corp <ML> is a major subcontractor\nalong with Raytheon's Equipment Division.\n    The company also said more than 4500 vendors and\nsubcontrators in 34 U.S. states, the Netherlands and West\nGermany are participating in the contract.\n    The company said the agreement will generate cost savings\nthorugh volume purchase discounts and efficient manufacturing.\n\"The contract will stabilize the production work forces at\nRaytheon and its subcontractors,\" it said.\n    The company said the defense system uses digital\nelectronics with a mulifunction phased array radar to locate\ntargets and control firing. It also uses launching stations for\nsupersonic missles.\n    The weapons are designed to defend against advanced\naircraft and cruise missles. They are also being modified to\ndefend against tactical ballistic missles, the company said.\n    West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Japan have\nchoosen the weapons for their air defense systems. A\nco-production program with the Japanese is currently underway,\nthe company added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In 1982 Consumers Power stopped taking oil under the\ncontract, claiming it was excused from buying more oil under\ncertain provisions of the accord.\n    Union Carbide said it plans to resell the real estate,\nlocated in northern Michigan, according to Consumers Power.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier\nreporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier\nprofit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write\ndowns totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in\ndeferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.\n    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign\nexchange losses, the company said.\n    \"The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses\nmuch of the progress the company has made in the two previous\nyears,\" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.\n    \"But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little\nbearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,\" chairman\nMacdonald said.\n    \"It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the\ncompany's assets in today's economic environment, and the\nabsolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders\non a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued\nexistence,\" he added.\n    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for\nrestructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.\n    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated\nforeign exchange losses to current expenses because of the\nuncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.\n    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining\nperiod of the loans to which they apply, it said.\n    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter\nreduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20\nbillion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of\n305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a\ncharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in\nthe third quarter.\n    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge\nresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full\ncost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of\nChartered Accountants.\n    The company said it previously determined a write down of\nconventional oil and gas properties was not required at\nSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating the\nlimitation of oil and gas values.\n    Dome said the most significant accounting change under the\nnew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in\ncalculations instead of escalating price forecasts.\n    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude\nthe company from making an accurate estimate of future\nfinancing costs, which are used in the new accounting\ncalculations, it said.\n    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10\npct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially\nconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission, the company said.\n    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural\ngas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71\nbillion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.\n    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas\noperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion\ndlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.\n    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of\nDome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also\ncontributed to the decline, it said.\n    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79\npct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago\n542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0\nmln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.\n    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained\nat prior year's levels through new drilling activity and\nimprovements in productivity.\n    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of\nlower domestic and export sales, it said.\n    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled\n86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.\n    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day\nfrom 591.0 mcf a day.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Pacific Gas and Electric Co said\nit expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,\nreduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to\nchange the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power\nPlant revenues.\n    The accounting change will not affect the company's cash\nposition and the company intends to continue paying its\ndividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.\n    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or\n2.60 dlrs per share.\n    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by\ndelays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities\nCommission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate\nrelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing\nunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.\n    It said the commission is currently allowing the company to\nrecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.\n    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month\nas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been\nincluded in current income.\n    But the accounting change, effective January 1, will\nreflect only cash received through interim rates approved by\nthe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.\n    It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public\nStaff Division's report which will recommend how much of the\n5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to\nrecover in rates.\n    The company further stated that it is confident it will\nreceive an objective review of the facts.\n    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.\n    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power\nunits in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one\nwent into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in\nMarch last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The International Monetary Fund\npredicts that the industrial world will grow a sluggish 2.5 pct\nin 1987, a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast six\nmonths ago, monetary sources said.\n    The forecasts, prepared by the IMF staff, will form the\nbasis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officials\nof top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week.\n    The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 2.5\npct in the U.S., shaving a full one point off its original 1987\nforecast, released last fall.\n    The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive board\nbefore going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee here\nnext week and may be subject to slight revision, they said.\n    The Reagan administration has forecast 3.2 pct U.S.\neconomic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officials\nare predicting 2.5 to three pct.\n    The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around \n2.5 pct in West Germany, and 2.8 pct in Japan.\n    Washington has extracted promises from both West Germany\nand Japan that they will take measures to bolster their\ndomestic economic growth, to help reduce the massive gap\nbetween their huge trade surpluses and the record American\ntrade deficit.\n    Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and the\nU.S. are likely to do little to reassure currency markets.\n    In recent days, the dollar has come under heavy selling\npressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo will\ntake early action.\n    With no economic stimulus in sight, financial markets have\nreduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely to\nbalance U.S. trade, monetary analysts say.\n    Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growth\nin developing nations of around three pct this year, with\ndeveloping countries in the western hemisphere -- the\nCaribbean, Central and South America -- expanding 3.3 pct.\n    In its recent annual report, the Inter-American Development\nBank said Latin American nations need to expand between four\nand five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs of\nforeign debt.\n    Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve an\nexpansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nations\nwill average almost no growth at all, the sources said.\n    Also short of the mark is the level of industrial country\ngrowth. Western officials maintain the industrial world needs\nto expand at least three per cent annually -- against this\nyear's initial IMF prediction of 2.5 pct -- in order to support\nthe export drive of debtor nations.\n    Exports provide the indebted world, which owes western\ncreditors some 900 billion dlrs, with its principal source of\nforeign exchange for debt repayments.\n    In other forecasts, the IMF put overall global growth at\nabout 2.8 pct and output in the seven leading industrial\nnations at around 2.5 pct.\n    The seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany,\nBritain, France, Italy and Canada -- have become the main forum\nfor coordination of medium-term economic policies in the\nindustrial world. The prediction for the seven is also around\n2.5 pct growth in 1987.\n    The Fund put Canadian growth at about 2.7 pct, the French\nexpansion at 2.9 pct and Britain at 2.8 pct.\n    The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debate\non the World Economic Outlook and the U.S. debt strategy by the\nInterim Committee.\n    Those talks are one of several meetings between top\neconomic officials of industrial and developing nations during\nthe semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

We have less (corn and\nsoybeans) than we thought we had,\" he said, noting that hog and\npoultry production is up.\n    \"We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,\"\nsaid Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and\n15 pct in the preceding quarter.\n    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed\nconsumption.\n    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came\nin southeastern states, where yields are usually low.\n    \"We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields\nthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's\nopening,\" she said.\n    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the\ncrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from\nlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.\n    \"We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce\nstocks,\" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year\nat 6.7 billion bushels.\n    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long\nterm, \"But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down\nto where we could start rebuilding prices.\"\n    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report\ncould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more\nsoybeans.\n    The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage\ntalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.\n    \"There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law\nwe're working under today, and this report should reinforce\nthat,\" Frazier said.\n    \"We are seeing the program beginning to work,\" said Meyer.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Israel's parliament passed a 25\nbillion dollar state budget that lowers the taxes of highest\nwage earners in an effort to stimulate worker productivity,\nState Radio said.\n    Israelis are one of the most heavily taxed people in the\nworld. Under the new budget, about a quarter of which will go\nto defence, highest wage earners will pay income tax of 48 per\ncent instead of the current 60 per cent.\n    The bill passed less than an hour before the start of the\nnew fiscal year on April 1. It was held up by debates over\nspecific programs such as education fees and social benefits\nfor low wage earners.\n    The radio said the budget passed by a wide majority. Last\nyear's budget was about 19 billion dollars.\n    In January, Israel devalued its shekel currency by 9.75 per\ncent against the U.S. Dollar and the government agreed to lower\ntaxes of high wage-earners in an effort to stimulate exports\nand productivity.\n    The government, trade unions and industrialists in January\nalso agreed to extend 18-month-old price controls until March\n1988 in an effort to avert labour unrest and a return to hyper-\ninflation. Because of the controls, inflation dropped to 20 per\ncent in 1986 from more than 400 per cent in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Quarter-point prime rate increases to\n7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be\nfollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of\nthe Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.\n    \"Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but\nno rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.\n    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by\nChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.\n    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month\ncertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than\n1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime\nrate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.\n    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they\nsee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near\nterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to\nfollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,\nthe last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks\nlifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount\nrate increase in April of that year.\n    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since\nlast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct\nshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the\ncurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.\n    \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There\nshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2\npct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.\nLanston and Co.\n    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's\nmeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may\nwell foster higher interest rates soon.\n    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy\nchange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate\npressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat\nup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.\n    \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to\ntighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,\" said Joseph\nLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.\n    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the\nFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by\noffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for\nits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"\n    \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy\nchange,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. \n    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153\nbasis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not\nreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate\nincrease.\n    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise\n\"may have been less a response to interest rates than an\nattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"\n    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to\ndeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavy\nexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in\nan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.\n    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money\nto one another could help determine how many banks match the\nhigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.\n    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of\nfunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal\nfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly\n6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  \n    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting\ndemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the\nclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five\nand 6-3/4 pct.\n    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds\nrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the\n6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,\nbanks may not quickly boost their prime rates.\n    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many\nthat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to\nhelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost\na record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it\nexpected operating losses to continue \"for the foreseeable\nfuture\" as it continues to search for additional capital or a\nmerger partner.\n    The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received\na qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.\nThe auditors said their opinion was subject to First City\neventually obtaining additional capital.\n    \"The company believes that in order to address its\nlong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of\noperations, it will ultimately need several hundred million\ndollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more\nstrongly capitalized entity,\" First City said in a note to its\nfinancial statements included in the annual report.\n    \"Management believes that sufficient resources should be\navailable to cover interim capital concerns while additional\ncapital is being sought,\" the bank said.\n    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell\nor mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions\nto its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of\nits member banks.\n    \"The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less\nthan in 1986,\" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter\nincluded in the annual report. \"However, the ultimate return to\nsatisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the\nsuccessful resolution of the related problems of credit\nquality, funding and the eventual need for substantial\nadditional capital.\"\n    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a\ncredit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of\nFirst City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would\nbe modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid\ndefault.\n    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants\nlast year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120\nmln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.\n    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios\nexceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,\nFirst City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First\nCity National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of\n5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.\n    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate\nprices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs\nlast year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than\ndoubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of\n1986.\n    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total\nenergy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion\ndlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs \"should\nbe more modest.\" The amount represented 15 pct of First City's\ntotal loans.\n    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets\nnearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.\nChargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine\npct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount\ncould go higher.\n    \"The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate\nmarket and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio\nso long as the regional recession persists,\" First City said.\n\"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is\ncollateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of\nthe collateral base could cause an increase in the level of\nreal estate-related chargeoffs.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The complex task of wielding control\nover monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global\neconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the\nnewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.\n    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the\nmaking of monetary policy. But they would be given a much\ngreater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert\nHeller, who joined the board last August.\n    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\nargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\nadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\nvolatility of exchange rates.\n    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\ncommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\n    His idea, which many conservative economists find\nappealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\nrecent years by President Reagan.\n    It would complement the present system of opening or\nclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\nkey indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\nthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to\nchanges in interest rates and affect economic activity\ndirectly.\n    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\nis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\npolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\nbase.\n    \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\nserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\npurposes,\" says Heller.\n    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States\nwent off the gold standard because the global economy had\nvastly outstripped gold supplies.\n    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\nhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\nproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.\n    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\n1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\n    But the current system of floating currencies in which\ncurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\nmonetary system, is also being widely questioned.\n    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\nformal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\ncurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\nmajor problems with this also.\n    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\nmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\ndetrimental to their own domestic economy.\n    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\nmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\nwith the fundamental judgement.\n    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\nto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\ncope with their overpowering debt problems.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's\nchief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\nGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a\nforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\neconomic matters.\n   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind\nclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\nposturing.\n   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\nprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\ninternational exchange rates.\n    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major\ncommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\nand prices would be measured on a regular basis.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\npolicy might be eased,\" he says.\n    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\nmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\nvirtually continuous basis.\n    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\ntraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\nfor the entire world,\" he says.\n    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\nproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\nproduction processes.\n    \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\nindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\nthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\nmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\n    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity\nsuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by\nthe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.\n    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow\nmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity\nto the rest of the system and to other commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Emery Air Freight Corp said it\nplans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83\npct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.\n    The company said the tender offer is the first step in a\nplan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.\n    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40\ndlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining\nPurolator share outstanding.\n    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share\nleveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton\nLBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.\n    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger\ndiscussions with Purolator before the company accepted the\nmanagement-led buyout offer.\n    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,\nEmery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still\nprefer to negotiate with Purolator.\n    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout\ngroup's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited\ntender offer of its own.\n    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on\nApril 28, unless extended.\n    The company said conditions of the offer include the\nreceipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares\noutstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its\nshare purchase rights plan.\n    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the\npreviously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.\n    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty\nTrust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for\nthe tender offer.\n    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in\nthe subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,\npayable twice a year.\n    For the first three years after the notes are issued,\ninterest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in\nadditional notes, Emery said.\n    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption\nfor one year after they are issued.\n    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit\nof the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's\nmanagement would continue with the company.\n    \"We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit\nwith each other and that the combination will enable each of us\nto better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges\nof the future,\" Emery's chairman said in his letter.\n    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial\nturnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.\n    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for\ncomment on the offer, which was released several hours after\nthe stock market had closed.\n    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.\n    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "\"If we go on using up\nfarmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in\n20 years to grow grain on.\"\n    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on\nthe edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it\ntries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same\ntime let them get richer by building factories and new homes.\n    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,\nbut only one seventh of its land is arable.\n    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into\na net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in\n1986.\n    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which\nhas occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for\nfactories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.\n    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of\nits arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller\namount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during\nthe two years.\n    \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the\nindustrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly\nall the families in the county have built new homes and many\nfactories have gone up.\"\n    \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But\nland losses in future should fall because nearly all families\nalready have new houses, she added.\n    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the\nPeking leadership, which announced earlier this month that\nChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land\nfor the first time this year.\n    \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,\nwasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said\nan article in the official press explaining the new measures.\n    \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it\nsaid. \"China has a large population and its land resources are\nbadly deficient.\"\n    An official of the Shanghai city government said county\nauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of\narable land to other uses, while anything more than that must\nbe approved by the city government.\n   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its\nefforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The\nprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making\nit more profitable for them to grow other crops.\n    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser\nand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to\nbuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to\nChina's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise\ngrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.\n    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the\nproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.\n    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the\neastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too\nmuch to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city\ngrain prices without any problem.\n    But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the\nprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social\nstability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month.\n    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the\nlong term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large\npopulation which is used to price stability and will object to\nprice rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\"\n    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might\nalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with\ngrain and consumed by city residents.\n    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate\ninvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.\n    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm\npolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth into\nbuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.\n    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign\ncontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,\nbut they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.\n    \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at\nthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the\nfuture,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.\n    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to\nuse the land but not own it. For most of the period of\nCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives where\nthere was little room for individual initiative.\n    \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency\nof government policies and make them interested in long-term\ninvestment,\" the newspaper said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The grain output of a major Chinese\ngrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers\nlack incentives, production costs are rising, storage\nfacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in\ngrain, the province's vice-governor said.\n    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,\nas saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as\nthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash\ncrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct\nof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment\nhad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.\n    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct\nof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.\n    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was\nhit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a\nfurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.\n    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt\nwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more\ninvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use\nof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the\ntendency to rely on grain imports.\n    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to\nthe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said\nthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to four\npct from 11 pct.\n    \"With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few\nyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention\nto grain and cotton production,\" he said.\n    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be\nself-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the\nnortheast, but it imports wheat.\n    \"Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach\nthe 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered\nadequate,\" Tian said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "President Reagan made public a\ndetailed set of orders to his national security staff designed\nto prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.\n    In a message to Congress accompanying National Security\nDecision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: \"(The reforms) are\nevidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,\nincluding consultation with the Congress.\"\n    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was the\nfirst time the duties of the national security staff had been\nspelled out in such a document since the National Security\nCouncil (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.\n    The orders implement the recommendations of the Tower\nCommission, named by the president to investigate the secret\nU.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.\n    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted the\nconduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for being\nunaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.\n    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech on\nMarch 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covert\noperations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which calls\nfor a \"small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experienced\nin the making of national security policy.\"\n    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose \"clear vertical\nlines of control and accountability.\"\n    The eight page document said the NSC's use of private\nindividuals and organisations as intermediaries to conduct\ncovert activities would be \"appropriately limited and subject to\nclose observation.\"\n    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser who\nwould have access to all information. The national security\nadviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies and\noperations and ensure that consultations and presidential\ndecisions are adequately recorded, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It is\nexpected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a\nyear earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.\n    Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to\nrise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year\nearlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.\n    The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to\nclimb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987\nfrom 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the\nfirst quarter of this year.\n    Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the\nU.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly\n50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.\n    He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains,\nmachinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise\nsharply because of government efforts to balance trade with\nWashington. He declined to give figures.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management\nboard chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present\nviewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be\nlower than in 1986.\n    In the first two months of the year, partial operating\nprofit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -\ndeclined, he said, without giving details.\n    The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of\n1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the\nquiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.\nBy contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.\n    German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp\nsaid last year the figure for the first time had topped one\nbillion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was\naround 50 pct higher than this.\n    Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, \"we were able to raise the\nfull operating profit...Slightly above the record result of\n1985 because own account profits increased slightly.\"\n    He gave no concrete details but added that in January and\nFebruary, good own account trading profits meant that the drop\nin full operating earnings was more modest than that in the\npartial operating figure.\n    The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in\nfuture, developing, for example, more into investment banking,\nkeeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening\nexpenditures on fixed assets.\n    Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had\nbeen a strong growth in business volume.\n    Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2\nbillion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.\n    Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15\nbillion. It would have been around five billion marks higher\nstill if currency relationships had remained unchanged.\n    In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in\nthe year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56\npct despite pressure on credit rates.\n    The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a\nquarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost\nexclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.\n    Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more\nthan 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct\nto more than 650 mln.\n    As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose\nby 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.\n    Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year\nfrom 233 mln in 1985.\n    Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a \"high\ntwo-figure million\" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG\n<AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's\nmajority stake purchase booked last year.\n    The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in\ncredit business against profits from securities trading and\nearnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior\nyears, to its full extent.\n    Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the\nlargest part of the provisions were set aside for individual\nwrite-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of\nproblem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of\ncredit exposure to provisions improved further.\n    Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to\nproblem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into\ndollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.\n    \"This means that no open currency positions exist any longer\non the amount of the provision that is made against an actual\ndefault,\" he added.\n    Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the\nlast few weeks, he said, the international banking community is\nbetter armed than it was against payment problems.\n    All banks had significantly strengthened their capital\nbase, most European banks had made considerable provisions\nagainst bad debts while goverments and central banks were\nbetter prepared for unforseen difficulties.\n    He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new\napproach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of\ninterest in direct investment via an equity participation in\nLatin America, particularly from West German firms.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Bundesbank should take further\nsteps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from\nfurther appreciation and to persuade investors to bring\nlong-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management\nboard chairman Walter Seipp said.\n    But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not\nmean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in\nmoney market rates through bringing the allocation rates down\nfor Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.\n    \"Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,\" he said.\n\"The money market rates are the important ones.\"\n    Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating\nmoney market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent\ntender allocations.\n    An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of\ncredibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary\ngrowth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of\nthe high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital\nformation, braking the expansion of money supply.\n    \"Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of\nmonetary growth both at the same time,\" he added.\n    Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a\npicture of the German economy, since company profitability had\nimproved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were\nprofiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.\n    Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,\ndescribing the downturn in production in the first months as a\nfalse start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.\n    After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the\neconomy should show an uptrend in the last three. \"We don't\nbelieve that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a\n'growth dip,'\" Seipp said.\n    But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal\npolicy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should\nbe brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.\n    The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January\nwere no substitute for support for growth.\n    Seipp added the federal government should make \"further\ncourageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the\nGerman economy and to increase its flexibility.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management\nboard chairman Walter Seipp said he hoped the bank would this\nyear found a 100 pct investment bank subsidiary in New York.\n    He told the annual news conference that the move would be\nan important and necessary widening of business activities in\nthe U.S.. This is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake in\nEuroPartners Securities Corp, New York, owned along with other\nEuropean banks in a consortium.\n    It would also be a further step in Commerzbank's full entry\ninto global investment banking around the clock.\n    Seipp also said securities trading activities had been\nconsiderably strengthened in London. The founding of Commerz\nSecurities (Japan) Co. Ltd, which would begin business in the\nfirst half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in Tokyo.\n    In 1987 also, Commerzbank planned to open a representative\noffice in Istanbul. Currency trading had begun in the Los\nAngeles branch, he added.\n    At home, Commerzbank would probably bring the automotive\nsupply group Boge and clothing manufacturer Ahlers to a stock\nexchange flotation in the first half of this year.\n    But the placement of shares in the print communications\ntechnology group <Linotype GmbH>, to be bought from Allied\nSignal Inc <ALD.N> would likely come later since several parts\nof the business had to be consolidated first.\n    Seipp said the purchase price had been \"several hundred\nmillion dollars.\" But he gave no further details.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Thai stocks have broken all expectations\nand brokers and securities analysts said the nine-month bull\nmarket on the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) should last\nthrough 1987.\n    Most had earlier dismissed a forecast by a local newspaper\nlast December that the SET Index would rise 50 points to 250 by\nmid-1987. They said the figure is now within easy reach.\n    The index, an average of the 93 registered stocks listed on\nthe market, gained 9.7 pct this month to finish the first\nquarter at 228.97.\n    The index has gained 74 pct since last July after declines\nof two pct in the first half of 1986 and five pct in 1985.\n    Yothin Aree, assistant managing director of Bangkok First\nInvestment and Trust Ltd (BFIT) echoed most analysts in saying\nthat, barring dramatic increases in oil prices and world\ninterest rates, the market will sustain its rally for the rest\nof the year, punctuated by periodic corrections.\n    Securities analysts said stocks are the best investment\nbecause of excess liquidity, which has forced interest rates to\n10-year lows. Bankers expect deposit rates, which have fallen\nsix times since January 1986, to stabilise this year.\n    Central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul told commercial\nbanks last week they should spur loan demand by cutting lending\nrates without a matching reduction in deposit rates.\n    SET statistics show daily trading in listed corporate\nstocks and government bonds averaged 217 mln baht during the\nfirst quarter, about 4.5 times higher than a year ago.\n    Robert Chan, deputy managing director of Wardley Thailand\nLtd, said foreign interest in Thai equities is strong and a few\nJapanese fund managers recently approached him for the first\ntime to seek advice on investing in the market.\n    Wardley Thailand, affiliated with The Hongkong and Shanghai\nBanking Corp, handles stocks acquired by many foreign fund\nmanagers investing in SET.\n    \"We thought six months ago that Thai stocks might have been\noverpriced after a significant 23.5 pct rise of the SET Index\nduring the third quarter,\" Chan said, adding it has since gained\n41 pct.\n    He forecast the index could advance 30 to 40 points more by\nyear-end given the improving Thai economy, foreign interest in\nThai stocks and SET's average 12 pct price/earnings ratio,\nwhich is relatively low by world standards.\n    Foreign investment accounted for 1.22 billion baht, or 7.8\npct of total turnover, in the January/February period, up from\n347 mln baht, or 5.8 pct, for the whole first quarter of 1986.\n    Foreigners can invest in the market directly, or through\nthe Bangkok Fund or Thailand Fund, unit trusts set up as a\nportfolio investment vehicles for foreigners.\n    Bangkok Fund was set up by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets\nand Cazenove and Co in 1985, while the Thailand Fund was set up\nlast December by Vickers da Costa International Ltd, Morgan\nStanley and Co Inc, Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, BIL\n(Asia) Ltd and the World Bank's International Finance Corp.\n    Each trust is capitalised at 30 mln dlrs and has invested\nmore than 70 pct of its funds in equities.\n    Brokers said demand for Thai stocks has strengthened\ncriticism the market, with 2.9 billion dlrs capitalisation, is\ntoo small and its trading narrowly based.\n    Although an average 50 issues are now traded a session,\nagainst 30 a year ago, most foreign fund managers focus on less\nthan 10 easily tradeable blue chips. Yothin said investors do\nnot seem interested in smaller or speculative issues.\n    Long-term investment in SET is also restricted by laws\nlimiting foreign-held equity in most listed companies.\n    Foreign equity is limited to a maximum 25 pct in banks and\nis also the self-imposed limit in popular Siam Cement. Most\nother businesses have a 49 pct limit.\n    SET officials said foreign investment in blue chips has\nreached a limit and the barrier will likely slow investment as\nfund managers are reluctant to buy smaller issues.\n    SET President Maruay Phadungsith said his priority is to\nlist more stocks this year and is waiting for government\napproval to launch a second trading board, where less\ndiversified companies with short track records can be listed.\n    SET hopes to list 10 new issues this year against only one\nin 1986.\n    SET officials added state enterprises that have delayed\nplans to go public are missing a golden opportunity to attract\ncapital through the exchange as their shares would be popular.\n    A plan for state-owned Thai Airways International Ltd and\nBangchak Petroleum Co Ltd to go public this year appears less\ncertain because of opposition from their administrations.\n    The privatisation of Krung Thai Bank Ltd has also been put\nin doubt by a Finance Ministry decision this month to merge it\nwith ailing government-owned Sayam Bank Ltd.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Investors are unloading holdings of\nHong Kong stocks following a spate of new share issues by\nleading local firms, analysts said.\n    The Hang Seng index fell 61.07 to 2,713.81 yesterday on\nspeculation that Hutchison Whampoa Ltd planned a bonus issue of\nnew \"B\" shares.\n    After yesterday's market close Hutchison and its parent\nCheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd both announced one-for-two bonus\nissues of \"B\" shares. The news sent the index down 63.51 points\nto 2,650.30 in today's morning session.\n    The Cheung Kong companies' issues  followed Jardine\nMatheson Holdings Ltd's announcement on Friday of a\nfour-for-one bonus issue of new \"B\" shares.\n    There is also market speculation that Evergo Industrial\nEnterprise Ltd will make a similar move, following a request\nfor suspension in share trading by the firm today.\n    Analysts said these new issues will have an adverse impact\non trading.\n    James Miller-Day, director of County Securities Asia Ltd,\nsaid: \"I don't like the concept of \"B\" shares because it will\ncreate inequality among equities.\"\n    He said the issue of \"B\" shares could create a conflict of\ninterest with holders of other classes of shares, noting most \"B\"\nshares are issued at a par value equivalent to one-tenth of the\n\"A\" shares, but enjoy similar voting rights.\n    Other analysts said the new issues also renewed concern\nover local corporate attitudes towards political changes in\nHong Kong after the British colony reverts to China in 1997.\n    Controlling shareholders can maintain control of local\nfirms by issuing cheaper shares, with much of the new stock\nbeing distributed to themselves, analysts said.\n    Those shareholders can reduce their investment exposure\nhere by selling some of their \"A\" shares and using the funds for\nnew investment, possibly overseas.\n    An analyst at a major brokerage house said Li Ka-shing,\nchairman of both Cheung Kong and Hutchison, might be planning\nto fund future expansion by switching \"A\" shares for \"B\" shares.\n    Other analysts noted that the Cheung Kong group has already\ntaken a major stake in Husky Oil Ltd of Canada and a minority\nshare in Pearson Plc of Britain.\n    Hutchison has begun a major project to expand berthing\nfacilities at its Hong Kong International Terminal Ltd and\nCheung Kong will bid for a big land reclamation development at\nHong Kong harbour.\n    The analysts said timing of the new issues was wrong\nbecause the local market had already been hit by declines on\nWall Street and London since the beginning of the week.\n    \"(The issues) came at a time when world stock markets are\nreeling from tensions between the U.S. And Japan over their\ntrade relations,\" said Barry Yates, director of Hoare Govett\nAsia Ltd.    Jardine Matheson's shares enjoyed a brief rally after the\nannouncement of the new issue, though they have lost 2.50 H.K.\nDlrs since last Friday to stand at 22.30 dlrs today.\n    Cheung Kong was down two dlrs from yesterday's close at\n41.25 dlrs and Hutchison fell 3.25 dlrs to 49.75 dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

What's going to happen when a lot of these golden\nhandcuffs come to an end?\" Rivkin said.\n    \"Only then will the banks know what they've got,\" he said.\n    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai\nBanking Corp <HKBH.HK> unit <Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a\npublic float of between 25 and 30 pct.\n    \"My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They\nleave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if\nwe weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but\nthat hasn't happened,\" he said.\n    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could\nfind it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull\nmarket ends.\n    In the last two years, the value of the Australian\nsharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to\n31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.\n    That growth put existing trading systems and clearing\nhouses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign\nexchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based\ntrading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.\n    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a\npilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on\nits reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors\nover the next four years, industry sources said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The dispute is\nbeing treated by the U.K. Government as a test case of the\nopenness of the Japanese telecommunications market.\n    Analysts said the coincidence of the timing of the\nannouncement by Toshiba with Cable's dispute could increase\npressure from the U.K. On Japan.\n    However, they noted that it was not a major move. Toshiba\nalready has a sizeable presence in the U.K. While other\nJapanese companies, such as NEC Corp <NIPN.T> has a presence in\nthe key telephone -- telephone systems for businesses --\nmarket.\n    Cable shares were quoted seven pence lower in morning\ntrading at 367p.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A minor tax payment period on behalf\nof customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension\npayments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.\n    Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system\non the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said\nthey expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with\na new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.\n    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seipp\ncalled on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect\nthe mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities\nrepurchase agreements down.\n    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit\npolicies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign\npressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.\n    Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively\ndrained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to\nachieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers\nsaid.\n    Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7\nbillion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the\nfirst 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one\nday before the end of the month.\n    Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks.\n    Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency\nfunding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to\ndraw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet\nBundesbank needs, the data showed.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Turkey's banks are reporting a strong\nrecovery in 1986 profits, but a government drive to liberalise\ncapital markets poses new challenges to a banking industry\nseeking to broaden its earnings base.\n    A dozen of Turkey's 55 banks have announced higher 1986\nprofits so far, a trend bankers in the financial capital of\nIstanbul expect to be reflected through most of the industry.\n    But while Ankara's policy of liberalising markets offers\nnew opportunites to expand operations, some bankers see dangers\nattached to a related drive to push down Turkish interest\nrates.\n    Bankers said the government's policy of fostering lower\ninterest rates could lead to a consumer boom and reignite\ninflation, currently running at about 30 pct. They worry that\nthis could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit\nbase.\n    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build up\ntheir capital market operations as Turkey's market-oriented\nPrime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.\n    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly\nfrom foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But a\ngrowing volume of trading in government securities is now also\na major source of revenue for banks.\n    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from\nthe traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,\nand some have even been making a loss on these operations.\n    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980\nwhen the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in\n50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an\ninflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.\n    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the\nBosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to\npay depositors real interest rates for the first time and\nprofits started to fall. Previously, rates had been below\ninflation.\n    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the\nexport drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reaped\nthe benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. The\nnumber of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.\n    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exports\ndeclined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985\nand bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.\n    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have\nstarted moving into capital market operations to broaden their\nearnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a\nyear ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.\n    \"When we saw that there was a demand and supply of money\noutside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves\nexcluded from these transactions,\" said Osman Erk, deputy\ngeneral manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.\n    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading\ngovernment securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the\nmarket was revived in December 1985.\n    Liberalisation went one step further last week when\nparliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.\nLast month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's first\ncommercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.\n    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strong\nrecovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603\nmln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to\n30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. Bankers said both benefited\nfrom trade finance and increased capital market operations.\n    Turkey's second biggest bank, the private Turkiye Is\nBankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3\nbillion in 1985.\n    However, bankers said some banks have been \"window dressing\"\ntheir balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which are\nvariously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of the\nindustry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.\n    Non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s as\nindustry failed to cope with higher interest rates and started\nto default. Some banks continued to count loans as performing.\n    \"After 1984 all banks started to be more careful in giving\ncredits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the period\nbetween 1980 to 1984,\" Erk said.\n    But the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three state\nbanks of medium-sized Turkiye Ogretmenler Bankasi AS earlier\nthis year when the Treasury, which acts as a watchdog body over\nbanks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extent\nmade up of non-performing loans.\n    Some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loan\nportfolio was non-performing. But the bank had reported a 1986\npre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.\n    Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance\nsheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank\nto standardise accounting.\n    Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory\nauditing by international accounting companies.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Over 10 pct of\nthe total available shares has been reserved for staff.\n    The statement said applicants for over 5,000 shares will\nreceive 30. There is a sliding scale which gives relatively\nmodest applications a higher proportion and those who sought\nbetween 101 and 500 shares will receive five. No shares will be\ngiven to applicants for fewer than 100 shares.\n    Glaverbel's net consolidated profit rose to 542 mln francs\nlast year from 137 mln in 1985 and the group is to pay a 29\nfranc gross dividend, its first for over 10 years.\n    As a result of the offer, some 45 pct of Glaverbel's\ncapital, or two mln shares, will be listed on the Brussels\nbourse.\n    Share dealers said some of the weakness on the bourse\nrecently probably has been due to the amount of money tied up\nin Glaverbel applications.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A proposed sales tax on gold transactions\ncould put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of\ntrading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and\nTokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press\nconference.\n    \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,\nTokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\"\nhe said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would\nbe unable to compete in the international market, he added.\n    \"How can the government really raise taxes if the system\nthey impose is prohibitive of generating business?\" he said.\n    The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades\nexceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen\ntax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.\n    The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading\nmore than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,\ngold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as\nthat of jewellery and coins, dealers said.\n    However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and\ncoins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.\n    Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold\nturnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.\n    A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early\n1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks\nfell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.\n    Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the\nvolume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.\n    While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the\nvolume of trades outside the country, particularly in London\nand Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.\n    Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average\njust under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.\n    Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the\ngovernment had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to\ncommemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers\nsaid.\n    Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese\ntrading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign\nparticipant.\n    Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one\nand 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while\nfutures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers\nsaid.\n    \"All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo\nmarket is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three\nmajor financial markets in the world ... And in my personal\nopinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper\non this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,\"\nHofer said.\n    \"I don't think it fits the philosophy of an\ninternationalising market,\" he added.\n    Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,\nattending the press conference, said they supported Credit\nSuisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Indian Finance Ministry's\nannouncement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's\ninterest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture\nby providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.\n    The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial\nbank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct\nby one percentage point.\n    New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also\ninclude a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on\ndeposits of two years or more but less than five.\n    Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct\ninterest have been abolished.\n    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the\ngovernment's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help\nimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods.\n    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits\nby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create\nthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity\nshares or short-term bank deposits, they said.\n    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due\nto lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.\n    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,\nopened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing\nof 1,012.50 rupees.\n    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now\nto buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the\nFinance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5\npct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.\n    \"But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the\nrates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks\npay for deposits of similar maturity,\" a merchant banker said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In\nMarch the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.\n    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,\nand despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is\nmodest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.\n    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to\ncontinue in the short term.\n    A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices\nattempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as\nthe dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver\nwas positive.\n    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the\nother metals by such a margin, Montagu said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Government officials in Malaysia, a\nmajor cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join\nthe International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock\nrules were agreed in London last week.\n    Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January\nthe cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so\nfar a decision has not been announced. The government is said\nto be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers\nand traders told Reuters they are against the idea because\ncertain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.\n    Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The\ngovernment feels that the pact, through its buffer stock\nmechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is\nlabouring under surpluses, officials said.\n    But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's\nparticipation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for\nexports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.\n    They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at\ncurrent prices and said they are not prepared to accept it\nbecause a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially\nestimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.\n    Most growers and traders added they are also against a\nbuffer stock measure under the agreement which requires\nwithholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.\n    Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,\nmight be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30\nmln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this\nmight affect their economic viability, they said.\n    \"The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it\nwill be a real messy business for the government and the trade\nif it ever occurs,\" an industry source said.\n    The growers and traders also said that under new buffer\nstock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not\na member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also\nallowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.\n    Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as\nMalaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.\n    Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to\njoin the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need\nnot rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries\nto join the agreement even at a later date.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said\nprime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to\n7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.\n    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2\npct, the level at beginning of 1987.\n    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five\npct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on\nJanuary 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong\ndollar, he said.\n    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,\nwith three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against\nyesterday's five to 4-13/16 close.

In\nMarch the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.\n    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,\nand despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is\nmodest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.\n    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to\ncontinue in the short term.\n    A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices\nattempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as\nthe dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver\nwas positive.\n    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the\nother metals by such a margin, Montagu said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Chase Manhattan quickly followed.\n    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar\n- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the\nnews.\n    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the\nEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.\n    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears\nof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but\neconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose\npolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this\nweek, is already tightening its grip on credit.\n    \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the\nbanking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I\nwouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,\" said\nJeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.\n REUTER^M\n\u0003",

Each\nof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a\nparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to\nprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment.\n    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of\nAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger\nfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes\nbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.\n    \"Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,\"\nDelta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late\nlast night. \"There was really very little that remained to be\ndone.\"\n    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been\nfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport\nEmployees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill\na promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took\nplace.\n    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be\nenforced in a takeover by a larger company.\n    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials\nlast night spread the word by telephone that Western employees\nshould report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new\nDelta outfits.\n    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing\nWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western has\nbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western\nname was to have disappeared at midnight last night.\n    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to\nrepresent Western employees after the integration of the two\nairlines.\n    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are\nunionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.\n    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts\nwith Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the\nTeamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be\n\"extinguished\" after today.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The ICO executive\nboard's regular session this week has so far been confined to\nroutine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to\nrevive export quota negotiations, delegates said.\n    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when\nproducers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how\nquotas should be allocated.\n    Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among\nproducers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most\ncountries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September\ncouncil session to restart negotiations.\n    Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for\ntoday's producer meeting to exchange views on the market\nsituation, the producer delegates said.\n    The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week\nwas cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices\nin London and New York futures, traders said.\n    Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at\n1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.\n    The executive board session looks set to end today,\nfollowing a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a\nconsultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be\npresented to producers and consumers, delegates added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Kenya's economy will continue to expand\nthis year and the government will do more to encourage\ninvestment by foreign firms and the local private sector,\nPlanning Minister Robert Ouko said.\n    He told a news conference that the government would soon\ncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investment\napplications by local and foreign investors.\n    Praising the role of multinational companies and local\nentrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to\nmaintain a close working contact with the private sector.\n    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in\n1985, Ouko said.\n    This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee\nexports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,\nhe added.\n    \"Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,\nKenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,\" the\nplanning minister said.\n    \"High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade\nliberalisation and disciplined financial management are\nexpected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,\" he\nsaid.\n    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable\nweather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises\nannounced in February, the minister added.\n    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the\nlong rainy season, which is due to start about now.\n    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops\nincreased during the second half of last year.\n    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya\nrose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,\nhe said.\n    Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its\ncontribution to the economy and promised to improve government\ncooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact\nwith them.\n    \"I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its\ncontribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to\nmaintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector\ngrew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same\nperiod the previous year,\" he said.\n    Ouko said the \"one stop\" bureau was intended to stimulate\ninvestment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved\nin processing applications.\n    The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan\neconomy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation\nfalling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.\n    This was owing to higher agricultural production and the\nKenyan shilling's relative strength against other major\ncurrencies, the report said.\n    The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr\nlast year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half\nyearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in\nJuly-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during\nthe period.\n    This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of\n780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,\ncompared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in\nthe second half of 1985, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He believes it is\na misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulation\nis not as good as the U.S. system.\n    He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal\noffense. \"There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K.\ninspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer,\" Goodison\nsaid, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allows\nindividuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may\nincriminate themselves.\n    Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is to\npersuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in\nLondon. He said about 200 U.S. companies are now listed in\nLondon, enhancing their ability to raise capital.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

He declined\ncomment on local press reports which said the ministry would\nback a plan aimed at cooling British anger on the issue.\n    The press reports said Fumio Watanabe, head of the\nFederation of Economic Organisations, would propose that\nBritain's Cable and Wireless Plc be given a five pct stake in a\ntelecommunications firm and a seat on the board.\n    Watanabe was unavailable for comment. He has the tacit\nbacking of the government in his efforts to merge two\ntelecommunications companies into one competitor to Kokusai\nDenwa Denshin (KDD), which has a monopoly on international\ntelephone services here, industry analysts said.\n    In London yesterday, a Cable and Wireless spokesman said\nthe latest reported proposals are unacceptable.\n    Cable and Wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the two\ncompanies involved in the mooted merger.\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has personally\ntaken up the company's cause, charging that Japan is\ndiscriminating against foreigners.\n    The United States also has vented its anger at what it sees\nas Japanese attempts to limit foreign participation.\n    Watanabe originally proposed Cable and Wireless be given up\nto 3.0 pct of the merged firm. The press reports said this\ncould be raised to 5.0 pct, equal to the largest share of any\nJapanese firm. Britain opposes the proposed merger. REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report\nyesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year\nas profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged\nproducers to step up production, analysts said.\n    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile\nExchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as\nbearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply\nlower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in\nnearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.\n    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"The\nreport shows that hog producers have responded to a very\ndesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10\nmonths.\"\n    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures\nprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures\nfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still\nlock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy\nselling pressure today.\n    \"We have not had a period of profitability of this\nmagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hog\noperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been\nso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back\non their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog\noperation alone.\"\n    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was\nnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the\nslaughter increased from the previous year.\n    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we\ndidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state\nspring report, Levitt added.\n    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that\ncould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased\nprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to\nincrease production starting late last year.\n    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog\nherd resulted from a revision of the December report and\nwithout the revision, the March report might have been very\nclose to average expectations.\n    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major\nupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding\nherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more\nbearish than initially indicated.\n    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report\nto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant\ncontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because\ntraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.\n    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into\nconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May\nfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1\nreport, Fuller said.\n    Grimes said, \"As far as the distant months are concerned,\nif our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60\nlb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a\ntremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us\nto push down to the prices that the current futures show for\nthe July and August period.\"\n    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that\ndistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than\nthey were last summer.\n    \"If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs\nduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper\nthis year because we have six pct more numbers,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its\nbusiness outside West Germany.\n    Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World\ngroup net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended\nSeptember 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales\nwhich fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32\nbillion.\n    Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen\nexpected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected\nlosses in the mass steel-making operations this year.\n    Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this\nyear, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel\nturnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's\ntrading operations, he said.\n    Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article\npublished this week which spoke of a dispute between him and\nHeinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG,\nover planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Office of Management and Budget\ndirector James Miller said President Reagan opposes increases\nin the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol to\nhelp reduce the federal budget deficit.\n    In an address before a group of House Republicans, Miller\nreiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. \"I think\nalso he would opose an increase in the gas tax.\"\n    He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed his\nopposition to a cigarette tax hike. \"In the case of the\ncigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax is\nhigher than now, and the same on wine and spirits.\"\n    Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a tax\nhike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the\n1988 financial year.\n    House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommend\nan 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988\nbudget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left to\nthe tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.\n    Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenue\nincreases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrak\nrailroad, higher federal fees for services and larger\nindividual payments for social programs.\n    \"It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no tax\nincrease,\" Miller said.\n    He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set a\nnew tax on security transactions was \"a nonstarter\" with the\nWhite House. The tax would be a tax on capital which would\ndiscourage all but the most profitable short-term transactions\nand could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.\n    \"Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any tax\nincrease,\" Miller urged the Republicans.\n    Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for\n1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

David Boren\n(D-Okla.), Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)\nis working on a proposal for assisting the Farm Credit System\nthat Leahy said should be ready shortly after Congress's Easter\nrecess, set for April 13 through 20.\n    Leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheat\nand feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal to\nestablish mandatory production controls.\n    However, he said a bill offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)\nand Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would probably not pass\nCongress as presently written.\n    A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance to\nmidwestern grain producers, already passed by the House, may\nnot be considered by the Senate for another 10 days because\nmembers have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costing\nbillions of dollars, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In the\nsouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar\narea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water\nsupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the\nlast two years of drought.\n    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,\nsaid sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at\nbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last\nyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against\nlast year's harvested 48,000.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

I cannot\ncomment,\" the spokesman at Jardine's London office said when\nasked to react to a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.\n    The report said Jardine, which moved its place of domicile\nfrom Hong Kong to Bermuda in the wake of the agreement to\ntransfer the British colony back to China in 1997, was\ncontemplating a similar move for Hongkong Land.\n    The Daily Telegraph quoted Jardine chairman Simon Keswick\nas saying Hongkong Land was at a crossroads now that all its\nnon-property assets as well as its major residential properties\nin Hong Kong are being sold off.\n    This left the company to focus its attention on prime site\ncommercial property in Hong Kong's city centre only, it said.\n    \"If we can't find any opportunities here we may have to look\nabroad ...

No comparative figures\nwere available because of the new method of calculation.\n    In March, share and bond turnover rose 28 pct to 181.1\nbillion marks from the previous month, reversing the sharp\nturnover drop in February. Average daily turnover rose to 8.2\nbillion marks against 7.0 billion in February.\n    Bond turnover jumped 33 pct to 113.3 billion marks in\nMarch, giving an average transaction value of 455,000 marks\neach on the total 249,000 transactions. More than 90 pct of the\nturnover was in public authority bonds.\n    Share turnover rose 22 pct to 67.8 billion marks. With 1.5\nmln deals, share transactions averaged 45,000 marks each.\n    German shares accounted for Nearly 80 pct of share\nturnover. Foreign shares took up over eight pct and domestic\nand foreign options, about 12 pct. Deutsche Bank <DBKG.F> was\nthe most traded share in March, with 4.7 billion marks worth\nchanging hands.
