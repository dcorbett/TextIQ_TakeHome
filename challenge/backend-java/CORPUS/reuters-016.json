        "body": "Crude oil netback values in complex\nrefineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last\nFriday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,\naccording to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.\n    The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.\nrelected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly\ngasoline, and support from crude oil prices.\n    Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe\nrose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices\nthere. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or\nthree pct from the previous week.\n    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to\n19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.\n    Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a\nbarrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.\n    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell\nsharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample\ndistillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.\n    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of\n68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.\n    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were\nmostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of\nKuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light\nfell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.\n    On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.\nalso jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82\ndlrs on higher gasoline prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Commodities from gold to grains to\ncotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses\nin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of\ninflation and economic instability.\n    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New\nYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a\ntroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.\n    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that\ninflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations\nto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve\nChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,\nHarris Upham and Co., in New York.\n    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from\nthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their\ncommitment to support its value, and despite reports of\nintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.\n    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known\nas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term\ndirection of the currency markets.\n    \"Maybe they have some ideas or plans,\" said Chronowitz. \"If\nthey do, it's not evident.\"\n    \"It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market\ntake values to where they should be.\n    \"One way or another, we will force our major trading\npartners to stimulate their economies,\" as a measure to correct\nthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.\n    \"I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long\ntime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's\ngoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's\nhappening,\" he said.\n    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities\ncheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.\n    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds\nsaw the value of their investments falling and many are turning\nto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty\nMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of\nDominick and Dominick.\n    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout\nthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton\nposted broad gains.\n    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the\ngrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome\nsupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate\nexport demand.\n    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department\nraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by\ntwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.\n    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the\nChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately\nhigher.\n    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said\nhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at\nthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field\nwork to market animals.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community has told\nCongress that if textile legislation injuring EC interests is\napproved, there was no doubt the community would retaliate\nagainst U.S. exports.\n    Roy Denmam, head of the EC delegation here, issued the\nwarning in a letter to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the\nFinance Committee. A copy of the letter was provided Reuters.\n    Denmam told Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, that if the textile\nlegislation passed on its own or was included in an omnibus\ntrade bill and injured EC interests, \"there should be no doubt\nthat the EC will retaliate against the United States.\"\n    He added that \"at a time when U.S. textile exports to the EC\nare growing rapidly, one result of such retaliation would be a\nsubstantial reduction of U.S. exports and jobs.\"\n    The textile legislation, backed strongly by the industry,\nhard hit by imports, and by senators from textile-producing\nstates would impose new tough global quotas on textile imports\nand for the first time include Europe in the quotas.\n    Reagan Administration officials have also opposed the\ntextile legislation, saying that if it passed it would likely\nprompt a presidential veto.\n    Denman made his comments on the textile issue in a general\nassessment of the Senate trade bill, titled S.490.\n    He said he was concerned about provisions in the Senate\nbill that would limit, if not eliminate, the president's\ndiscretion if retaliating against nations for keeping their\nhome markets closed to foreign goods.\n    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has also opposed\nthose provisions, arguing that presidential flexibility was\nneeded in order to be able to negotiate with countries to open\ntheir markets, with retaliation being retained as a final, but\ndiscretionary, weapon.\n    The pending overall trade legislation would force the\nAdministration to consult often with Congress and seek its\napproval during step-by-step GATT negotiations.\n    He said \"enactment of S. 490 would reduce the confidence of\nother governments in America's commitment to multinational\ntrade.\"\n    Summing up the senate legislation, Denman said \"a number of\nprovisions of that bil may achieve the opposite of what is\nintended and lead to dangerous consequences for the world and\nthe U.S. economy.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Semiconductor Industry\nAssociation put the three-month average book-to-bill ratio at\n1.21, which was above analysts' expectations and reflects the\nsixth straight increase in this indicator of computer industry\nactivity.\n    Average booking in the three month period ended in March\ntotaled 910.8 mln dlrs, up 15.6 pct from a month ago and the\nhighest bookings since September, 1984. March billings, or\ncomputer chip sales in the month, totaled 912.1 mln dlrs, up\n34.6 pct from a month ago, the association said. The three\nmonth average billings totaled 751.3 mln dlrs, up 6.5 pct.\n    March billings were the strongest recorded since November,\n1984, the association said. The book to bill ratio, at 1.21,\nwas the highest since May, 1984, it noted.\n    Preliminary total solid state shipments for the first\nquarter of 1987 totaled 2.25 billion dlrs, up 4.9 pct from last\nquarter and up 15.9 pct from last year's first quarter.\n    Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew\nProcassini said the rise in the book to bill was due to a\nsubstantial increase in U.S. bookings during March.\n    \"We believe that the bookings increase reflects growing\nconfidence by electronic equipment manufacturers that some\nend-equipment market segments have improved substantially\nduring the first quarter,\" Procassini said in a statement.\n    The association also revised its book-to-bill ratio\nestimate for the three months ended in February to 1.12, from\n1.13 earlier. It further revised the January book-to-bill\nfigure to 1.09 from 1.12 estimated earlier.\n    The three-month average book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 for\nMarch means for every 100 dlrs worth of product shipped,\ncomputer chip maker received 121 dlrs in new orders.\n    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc analyst Michael Gumport said\nassociation numbers indicate March orders were up 20 pct above\nthe normal seasonal level.\n    The association does not break out March orders from its\nthree-month average, which it put at 910.8 mln dlrs.\n    Gumport noted the three-month average bookings were well\nabove the 800-865 mln dlrs anticipated by the industry.\n    He said semiconductor stock could rise five to ten pct on\nthe stock market open tomorrow, due to the positive numbers.\n    \"Skeptics are going to have to have some pretty strong\nreasons not to like this group (of stocks),\" Gumport said.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak said the ratio\nindicates March orders at about one billion dlrs, which would\nbe the highest monthly order rate since April, 1984.\n    He predicted at least a five pct rise in semiconductor\nstocks on the open, and said the stock group could soar as high\nas 15 pct during the session.\n    \"One month does not a boom-time make, but this is very good\nnews,\" he said.\n    Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders to\nstrength in the personal computer market, inventory restocking\nand strong buying by distributors.\n    Purchasing managers had been keeping computer chip\ninventories low, due to the overcapacity in the industry and\nthe slow growth of the economy in general, analysts noted.\n    The semiconductor industry has been in a slump for the past\nthree years.\n    The analysts said the March order and sales numbers are the\nstrongest evidence yet that the trend may be turning.\n    Nevertheless, they do not expect the Administration to\nretreat from proposed sanctions against Japanese chip makers.\n    They added, however, if the industry continues to improve,\nit could mean the sanctions will be short term.\n    Jack Beedle, President of In-Stat, an electronics industry\nresearch firm, called the March numbers \"excellent\", but also\ncautioned against excessive optimism.\n    \"I still believe caution should be the word, rather than\neuphoria,\" said Beedle, adding that he has yet to see strong\nindications from the general economy or the computer industry\nthat support a solid, long-term recovery.\n    Beedle said while he thinks the semiconductor industry will\nhave a very good second quarter, he still thinks positive\nshifts in exports and industrial production are needed to\nsustain a recovery.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Stancell, vice president of\nU.S. producing operations for the company.\n     Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company, responded\nto the collapse of oil prices last year -- from 30 dlrs a\nbarrel at end-1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986 -- by\nlaying off 5,500 people and cutting its budget in midyear by 27\npercent, or 1.1 billion dlrs.\n     Of that amount, more than 900 mln dlrs was eliminated from\nits exploration and spending spending plans.\n     But the company reported an increase in profits in 1986\nover 1985 and a jump in per share earnings to 3.45 dlrs a share\nfrom 2.55 dlrs.           \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Economists said that they doubt the\nFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite\nhigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week\nstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.\n    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged\n393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln\ndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were\n1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\n    \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\nprobably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\n    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\nmodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\ntwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\naround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\n    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\ntwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\noften pushes up borrrowings.\n    \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\nlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\nlate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said\nWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\nthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\nmore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\n    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\nits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\nreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\n    The Fed took no market reserve management action last\nThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\ntemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\ncustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\ndirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\ntwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\nTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\novernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\n    \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\nthis time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\n    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\nsaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\nrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\neconomies in the United States and abroad and add to the\nfinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\n    \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\nstatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\ntumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\n    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\nstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\nWashington meetings of international monetary officials failed\nto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\n    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\nWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\nthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\nimbalance between the United States and Japan.\n    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\nsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\nFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\nthe rate has been since early November.\n    \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\npolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\nDean Witter.\n    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\nnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\nsix to 6.10 pct previously.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The headquarters or\nmajor offices of Canada's six major banks line a small section\nof Bay Street, the Wall Street of Canada.\n    Bank of Montreal spokesman Brian Smith told Reuters the\nblackout shut down electronic banking machines and caused a\nminor slowdown in money trading operations, although \"all in all\nwe were not seriously affected.\"\n    Officials at various downtown skyscrapers said the blackout\nalso briefly shut down elevators and disrupted business in the\ndowntown core's extensive network of underground shopping\nmalls.\n    Workers at some of the buildings said several people were\nbriefly trapped on elevators, but police and firefighters\nreported no serious problems.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Administration's 15 billion dlr\nplan to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance\nCorporation is needed to ensure the future profitablity of the\nU.S. thrift industry, according to a top industry regulator.\n    \"Today thrifts in overwhelming numbers are profitable,\" \nShannon Fairbanks, executive chief of staff of the Federal Home\nLoan Bank Board told a thrift industry conference.\n    \"But every thrift is paying a market tax for the inabliity\nof regulators to deal with problems carried forward from the\npast,\" she said, referring to the premium that thrifts have to\npay in the marketplace to entice deposits away from banks.\n    \"The industry wants to see a five billion dlr plan passed\nnow, and then to wait and see what happens,\" Fairbanks said.\n\"They're saying, 'we don't want to pay more right away.' The\nargument is that it's a drain on the industry.\"\n    \"But the dollars paid out can be recaptured in the\nreduction in the market tax differential,\" she said. \"The cost\nof recapitalization to the industry would be recaptured in\nbottom line profitability.\"\n    Fairbanks said that the public's confidence in thrift\ninstititutions eroded with the financial difficulties of\nsavings and loan associations in Ohio and Maryland in 1985.\n    As thrift institutions in economically distressed areas\nlike Texas have continued to fall on hard times, this has\nincreased depositors' demand for a higher premium on deposits\nin savings and loans compared with premiums paid on deposits in\ncommercial banks, she said.\n    Before 1983, thrift institutions paid a 25 basis point\nyield differential on savings deposits over that offered by\ncommercial banks as mandated by U.S. financial regulations.\n    With the elimination in 1983 of regulations that had drawn\nstrict lines between savings and loans and commercial banks,\nthe gap widened to as much as 50 to 75 basis points as wary\ndepositors demanded a higher premium to place their funds in\nthrift institutions, Fairbanks said.\n    \"The market tax paid by today's thrift industry is the most\nsignificant impediment to future profits,\" she said.\n    Depositor confidence is also eroded by the existence of\nthrifts that are failing but manage to stay in business by\npaying deposit rates well above prevailing market rates.\n    Presently, the FHLBB cannot afford to close failing\ninstitiutions \"because we can't afford it with the current\nFSLIC fund,\" she said.\n    Fairbanks estimated that the high market tax differential\npaid by thrifts will drop by at least 10 to 20 basis points\nwith an adequate recapitalization of FSLIC because it will help\nrestore this lost confidence.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Lanston and Co Inc.\n    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\nfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\ncredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\nof further depreciation of the dollar.\n    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\nworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\naway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\ndlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\nin interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\nby 33 points to 2339.\n    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\nmarkets' instability frightening. He believes economic\nfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\nyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n    \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\ndestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\nand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\nin Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\ncontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n    \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\nthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\nyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\nwould take very little to touch off what he calls the second\nphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\ndollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\nMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\nhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\nnot affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\ndecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\nweakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\nsuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\nbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\npart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\nconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\nplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\nimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\nreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\naddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\nmassive budget deficit.\n    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\ncentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\nchoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n    \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\nsubstantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\ncut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\nrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\nAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\nCo, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\nReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\nagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\nweakness,\" he said.\n    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\nmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n    \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\nbudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\ncares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\nwill have been greater.\n    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\nthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\na further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\nyour helmets,\" Giordano said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

They added that they themselves do not feel\nany need for a cut at all.\n    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters\nearlier today that some countries - those with strong\ncurrencies - might have to cut interest rates.\n    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to\ncall the G-7 pact a failure.\n    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's\nrenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by\nremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the\ndollar's fall had been orderly.\n    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's\ncomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since\nthe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,\nnot the currency's recent movements.\n    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize\non anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or\nthe other.\n    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more\nweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market\nstability than on other currencies.\n    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers\nthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it would\nreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the\nU.S. And world economies, they said.\n    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors\nreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources\nsaid.\n    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,\nJapan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about\ncurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.\n    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a\ntriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and\ndollar/European currencies.\n    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did\nnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did\nnot object to the yen strengthening, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It was this problem that had prevented\ncompletion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.\n    Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending',\nwhich some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending'\nallows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.\n    Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be\nforced to sign \"exit bonds,\" prohibiting them from lending to\nthat country again, he said.\n    Languetin said none of these represented a general view.\nBut he added \"People are trying to get out of the corset.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc, in documents filed with a\nTexas state appeals court, said a ruling forcing it to post a\nbond of more than one billion dlrs as security for a 10.53\nbillion dlr judgment would halt its credit agreements and force\nthe company into bankruptcy.\n    A hearing is scheduled Monday on Texaco's motion to reduce\nthe amount of bond required by Texas state law to secure a 1985\njudgment in favour of Pennzoil Co <PZL> in a dispute over the\nacquisition of Getty Oil.\n    Pennzoil today said it proposed to the court that Texaco\nsecure its bond with assets valued at about 50 pct of the bond.\n    It said this would not force Texaco into bankruptcy.\n    Richard Brinkman, Texaco's chief financial officer, said in\na newly filed affidavit that the company was willing to use its\n65 mln shares of <Texaco Canada Inc> as collateral for a letter\nof credit or loan to provide security to Pennzoil.\n    The Canadian unit's stock, valued at about 1.8 billion\ndlrs, was returned to Texaco earlier this week after being held\nas security by a federal district court in New York while\nTexaco awaited a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. Brinkman\nestimated that Texaco could borrow no more than one billion\ndlrs using its Canadian subsidiary stock as collateral for a\nloan.\n    Texaco, he said, was unwilling to pledge the stock of its\nother foreign subsidiary corporations as security because the\nstock is not widely traded and its market value was unclear.\n    Brinkman also said the company had already lost access to a\nfour billion dlr revolving credit line since the initial jury\nverdict against Texaco.\n    Texaco had been able to raise working capital by selling\nabout 700 mln dlrs in receivables to a group of banks since the\njudgment, he said. The banks earlier this week notified Texaco\nthat they would not purchase any additional receivables because\nof the company's uncertain status, Brinkman said.\n    Four other credit agreements for 1.15 billion dlrs would\nalso be cut off if a judgment of more than four billion dlrs is\noutstanding against the company and it is unable to obtain a\nstay, Brinkman said.\n    \"Since the Supreme Court decision on April 6, many other\nsuppliers to Texaco have notified Texaco that their dealings\nwith it are under review and a number have demanded cash\npayment or terminated their dealings with Texaco,\" he said.\n    The Supreme Court overturned a lower federal court decision\nto cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, saying the issue\nshould first be considered in Texas courts.\n    In a separate affidavit, <Morgan Stanley & Co> Managing\nDirector Donald Brennan also said Texaco would be forced into\nbankruptcy if the company were forced to provide Pennzoil with\nsecurity exceeding one billion dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The bank board appointed the FSLIC as\nconservator for the association on April 14, 1986.\n    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board's\nManagement Consignment Program.

        "body": "A committee of the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank said protectionist\nagricultural policies of industrial countries were a major\ncause of depressed global commodity prices.\n    The joint Development Committee, in a communique released\nfollowing day-long discussions, said an improved environment\nfor commodities was extremely important to the long-term\nviability of developing countries.\n    The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending to\ndebtor nations.\n    Poorer countries, which rely primarily on raw commodity\nsales to industrial nations to pay their debts, have been\nhighly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in the\nUnited States, Western Europe and Japan.\n    \"Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies as\na major cause of distortions including depressed commodity\nprices on world markets, of surplus production and of budgetary\ndrain,\" the communique said.\n    The communique, delayed because of disputes over specific\nlanguage, was the final statement by the IMF and the bank after\nweek-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies.\n    Earlier, the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added its\nvoice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks on\ncritically needed loan packages for debt-laden developing\ncountries.\n    The committee said it welcomed the exploration of new\nprocedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise new\nfinancial support for indebted countries.\n    On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in a\nstatement to the policy-making committee, said commercial bank\nlending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and more\nflexibility in loan programs was needed.\n    \"Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve to\ncarry out needed reforms,\" Baker said.\n    The Development Committee also joined in the criticism,\nnoting that there had been a declining flow of capital to the\ndeveloping countries that \"has been particularly significant in\nthe case of flows from commercial banks.\"\n    A number of bank negotiations are bogged down over details\nincluding financial packages for Mexico, Nigeria and Argentina.\n    The banks, acknowledging it has been difficult to complete\ndeals, say part of the blame goes to the developing countries\nfor not making sufficient reform to make them good credit\nrisks.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane\nafter April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week.\n    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen\nmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking\noil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer\nprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing\nhundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.\n    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to\nreceive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a\nwarehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound\n(45-kg) bags of sugar.\n    \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.\nWe have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said.\n    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an\nadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.\n    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier\ntwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.\n    He said the government then began importing refined sugar\nat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and\nthe provisional military-civilian government that replaced\nDuvalier last year continued the policy.\n    \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete\nwith smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said.\n    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above\nthe usual minimum wage of three dlrs.\n    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian\nsupports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a\nminimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.\n    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We're dead,\nand it's the government that's causing us to die,\" declared\nLucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Taiwan announced plans for another round\nof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade\ntalks with Washington which officials described as a move to\nhelp balance trade with the United States.\n    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's\nCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list of\nproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.\n    \"The move is part of our government efforts to encourage\nimports from our trading partners, particularly from the United\nStates,\" he said.\n    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet\nthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,\napples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut\nby between five and 50 pct.\n    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday\nand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting\non April 20, he added.\n    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700\nforeign products last January aimed at helping reduce its\ngrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island's\nlargest trading partner.\n    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and\npressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade\ndeficit with Taipei.\n    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6\nbillion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It\nwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78\nbillion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.\n    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of\na 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of\ntrade talks with U.S. Officials.\n    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last\nnight he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would\nface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist\nsentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus\nwith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.\n    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.\nCalls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,\npurchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,\nimport tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.\n    \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from\nour talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A British minister said he had given the\nJapanese government a clear warning of sanctions against\nJapanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its\ninternal markets \"and it was clearly understood.\"\n    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his\nreturn from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were\nbeginning to appreciate the need to be \"fair and open\" about\naccess to their own markets.\n    At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition\ncharges that his trip had been a failure because he had\nreturned empty-handed.\n    \"I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear\nmessage to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very\nclearly, and it has been clearly understood.\"\n    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the\ngovenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions\nagainst Japanese companies and finance houses operating in\nBritain.\n    \"It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing\noperating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries\nfrom carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing\nthem to carry out other kinds.\"\n    \"I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it\nclear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use\nthem.\"\n    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became\ninvolved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained\nmore than anyone else from an open trading relationship.\n    \"I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this\nrelationship is to continue, it is very important for them to\nbe fair and open about access to their own markets.\"\n    On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc\n<CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of\ntelecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told\nthe Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.\n    He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and\nWireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,\nhe said.\n    Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\nsaid Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,\nbut would have to coordinate action with its European Community\npartners.\n    Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials\nyesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a\nrange of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States\nmarkets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as\nit has threatened.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing\nconditions continued until next month.\n    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the\nlosses would be offset by the expected increase in output in\nother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry\nspell.\n    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),\nrepresenting a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8\nmln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.\n    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at\n170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.\n    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been\nhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total\nthus the damage is considered negligible.\n    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by\nproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversified\ninto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.\n     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production\nin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to\n320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued.

From today the price of meat will rise by an average\n18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.\n    MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,\nwith the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also\nannounced a number of measures to ease hardship, including\nhigher pensions and family allowances.\n    Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to\n47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the\nFinance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between\n30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.\n    A major tax reform, including the introduction of a\nWestern-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in\nan effort to cure problems in state spending.\n    But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the\nauthorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's\ndeficit under control.\n    The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated\neconomy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for\nimported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive\nhard currency, the diplomats said.\n    The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect\nthe kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in\nother East Bloc states, notably Poland.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc <TX> said its decision to\nfile for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy\ncode will not affect the majority of its businesses.\n    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its\n32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,\nplant and equipment, were free of the action.\n    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating\nsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are\naffected, it said.\n    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents\nper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments\non debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.\n    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were\ndemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a\nresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.\n    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond\nof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985\njudgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's\n1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almost\nmatches the damages awarded against Texaco.\n    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin\nto attach its assets to secure the judgment.\n    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut\nTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to\nthe Texas courts.\n    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all\nTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of\nthe Pennzoil lawsuit.\n    \"Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond\nissue and the larger dispute failed,\" James Kinnear, Texaco's\npresident and chief executive officer, told reporters.\n    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on\nFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until\nthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.\n    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash\nbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of\nearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not\nsell any assets, Kinnear said.\n    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of\ncredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under\n11.1 billion dlrs, he added.\n    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the\ncompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on\nSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for\nbankruptcy.\n    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a\nconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco\ntold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go\nto bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said.\n    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would\nprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were\nample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "National Bank economic data for 1986\nshows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate\nrose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and\nthe value of the dinar fell.\n    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct\nhigher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three\nmonths of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard\ncurrency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.\n    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in\ndinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars\nbased on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.\n    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the\nconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344\nmln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a\ndeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency\narea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.\n    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while\nindustrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data\nshowed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.\n    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.\n    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages\nwere too high given the level of productivity.\n    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the\nlast quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.\n    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money\nsupply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9\nbillion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of\nforeign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs\nabroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.\n    The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard\ncurrencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the\nSwiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,\n46.2 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "West Germany's capital market\nliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it\nmay take years for further reforms to be completed.\n    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banks\nreceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\n    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominated\ncertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, including\nrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction of\nfutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may\ntake years, bankers and dealers say.\n    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called\nlast week for an enlargement of current capital market\ninstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.\n    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,\nciting declines in West German share prices in the first two\nmonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.\n    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of\nviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading\nin domestic markets too risky.\n    \"We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures\ncontract for recent government bonds,\" one dealer said.\n    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of\nshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about\n30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.\n    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds\nselected when bond options were introduced last April. The most\nrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.\n    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German\nbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branches\nabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent\nWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a\none-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.\n    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing\nmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.\n    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in\noptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange\nlaws, which define losses made in futures and options business\nas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.\n    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from\npension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these\ninstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business\nsoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules\ngoverning funds.\n    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual\nfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be\nadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.\n    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the\npast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which\ngives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their\nintroduction here is growing.\n    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers\nconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in West\nGermany. They say that without innovations, some business could\ndrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.\n    An official at the London International Financial Futures\nExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to\nintroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing\nmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the\nfeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month\nmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.\n    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has\nno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization\nin that sector is still in the early planning stages after\nearlier talks ended two years ago.\n    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn\nout because of the large number of participants involved in\ntalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal\nBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges\nand their governing states, and the four West German banking\nassociations.\n    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested\ninclude replacing the federal government's current bond\nconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one being\nconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.\n    This would upset the existing market order providing German\nand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it\nwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently\narise within the fixed consortium quota system.\n    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond\ntrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system\nof continuous price-setting from the current system in which\nevery bond price is fixed once a day.\n    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the\nproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct\nof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome\nPetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>\nmay short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door\nfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.\n    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt\nof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim\ndebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer\nsubstantial payments to creditors will expire.\n    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders\nthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.\n    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as\npublic noteholders in March after several months of delicate\nnegotiations.\n    TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt\nrestructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker\nLtd said from Toronto.\n    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow\ncreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet\nto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to\ncash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.\n    \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that\neven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that\nDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"\nsaid Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in\nCalgary.\n    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome\nwas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed\nrefinancing packages, Gobert said.\n    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome\nsince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders\nto agree to a restructuring, he added.\n    \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain\nany and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.\n    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that\nTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix\nthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other\npossible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to\nus in our discussions, it means that others may be a little\nreluctant to come forward,\" he said.\n    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal\noffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a\nconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.\n    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions\nwith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other\nunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and\nfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including\nTransCanada's.\n    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price\nfor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.\n    However, he said not enough financial details are known\nabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of\nTransCanada's proposed offer.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Its capitalist system is to\nremain intact for 50 years under an arrangement similar to the\none that will return Hong Kong to China from Britain in 1997.\n    China hopes to win back the Nationalist-ruled island of\nTaiwan under the same \"one country, two systems\" formula.\n    \"The successful settlement of the question of Macao has\nproven and will continue to prove that the concept of 'one\ncountry, two systems' is realistic and therefore definitely\nviable,\" Zhao said.\n    Macao's population of 300,000 includes more than 40,000\nPortuguese passport holders.\n    Peking has said Chinese nationals in this category will be\nable to use their Portuguese passports after 1999 but will not\nbe entitled to Portuguese consular protection in Macao or\nelsewhere in China.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiaries\nwere unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications\nof the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy\nunder Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers\nsaid.\n    The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court\ndecision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue\nits court battles with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.\n    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, \"I don't\nwant to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in\nTexaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision\n(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it.\"\n    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding\neurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total\nborrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.\n    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar\nstraights - had been trading \"basis only\" for some time prior to\nthis weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way\nprice for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any\ntrades would be negotiated.\n    He said that recently there appeared to have been some\nspeculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European\ninvestors had been overall sellers.\n    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders\nwill receive no interest payments.\n    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible\ninto Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading\ndid not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer\nsaid, \"We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing.\"\nTexaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from\nhaving to post the court bond.\n    Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter\nshare dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with\nFriday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.\n    Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared\nwith Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Member states of the European\nCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which\nthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open\nits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.\n    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC\ncountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the\nwillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese\ngovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.\n    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as\nEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.\n    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to\nan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could\nraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.\nCarries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.\n    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations\nentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed\nto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of\nthe U.S.\n    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's\ntrade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in\nMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.\n    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion\ndlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one\npct to 12.43 billion dlrs.\n    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has\ndecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.\n    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen\nCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application\nof French quality standards -- something EC states say often\nhappens to their own exports entering Japan.\n    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese\nbanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,\nbecause the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in\ncompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.\n    However, British officials in London have said that the\ngovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would take\nimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.\n    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful\neconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring\nto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own\nindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.\n    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent\nyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open\nits market with specific demands for moves in key areas.\n    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end\nallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and\nspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts\nfor the building of a new international airport, and to\nsimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.\n    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but\noften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff\nbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.\n    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the\nEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.\n    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to\nwithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers\nwould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,\nthey point out.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Turnover rose to\n242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.\n    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in\nthe U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.\n    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one\nmln stg, it noted.\n    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector\nimproved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results\nwere nonetheless disappointing.\n    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed\ndefence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken\nthe necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was\nnow proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.\n    Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from\n316p at Friday's close.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Wheat sowing normally begins in May.\n    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be\ncut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were\nfacing enormous financial pressures.\n    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln\nhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about\n16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting\nintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.\n    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in\nplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed\nwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling\nwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.\n    \"Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat\nunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but they\nwill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to\ndecrease production,\" Condon said.\n    \"If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export\nincome earner, governments and government authorities will need\nto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing\nviability of the wheat industry,\" he added.\n    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,\nIran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the\nprice to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.\n    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10\nsouthern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.\n    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11\nprovinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest\nChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no\nmore price details.\n    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price\nincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourage\nproduction of grains and oilseeds.\n    Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow\ngrain because they can earn more from other crops.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

    {
        "body": "Euro-medium term notes, a recent\nphenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly\nattracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing\ntheir best to breath life into the market.\n    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering success\nin the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown to\naround 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a\nnew financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial\npaper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,\ninvestment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the\neuromarket.\n    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley\nInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on\nMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for\nraising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. \"It (the MTN\nmarket) will even surpass the bond market,\" he said.\n    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs\nwill grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments\nprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs\nthan a traditional bond.\n    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth\narranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude\nEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.\nCounterparts -- to buy the securities.\n    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is\nexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing\nthese issues.\n    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but\nonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of\nPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.\n    Several firms have devised different structures for\nEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.\n    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously\noffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with\nsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.\n    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised\nby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a\nminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.\nThe borrower then issues additional notes in this category up\nto a pre-determined maximum.\n    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as\nWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to\nthe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.\n    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the\nEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a\nmajor concern for these buyers.\n    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the\nmedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable\nliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the\nright option for all borrowers.\n    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,\nHadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well\ndetermine which structure is chosen.\n    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined\n\"lock-up\" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the\ncase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the \"lock-up\" period is\nthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which time\na security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.\nInvestors.\n    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange\nCommission is reviewing its current regulations on the\nownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some\nsoftening in the rules could come in the not too distant\nfuture.\n    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea\npigs.\n    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic\nInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would\nhave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but\nthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.\n    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to\nestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.\nDomestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue\nglobally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has been\nsold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The five institutes had jointly forecast\nthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\nand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\ndevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\nfavourable\" than those of the other three.\n    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\nslow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\nhowever, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n    The two institutes said external economic factors which\nwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\ndominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\nexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\nmarked improvement in the course of the year.\n    The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\ndemand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\nindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\nuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\nBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\nbut only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n    They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\nof the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\ncombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\ndemand and production could be expected by the spring.\n    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\nfurther development of the mark against the dollar.\n    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\nwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\neconomy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\nwill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\nthe course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\nin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\nrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\nwhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\npredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\nunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\njobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\nmln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\nwork of about 200,000.\n    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\nmainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\nthe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\nwas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\nbut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\nmanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\nin the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\nmanufacturing industry will decline.\"\n    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\nbillion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\ncurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\nand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\n100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\n    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\nrise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\npredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said\nmembers of management do not plan to participate in the\ntransaction, but they will retain their positions with the\ncompany.\n    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds\n19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.\n    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.\n    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to\nsell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo\nsecurity guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.\n    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for\nabout a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed\na takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the\nstock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup\nvalues for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and\nspeculated an offer would have to be sweetened.\n    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the\nMerrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their\nshares. The board received opinions on the offer from its\nadvisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,\nsaid, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction\nwith Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the\nemployees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its\nstrong presence in the Chicago community.\"\n    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,\nwhich expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject\nto conditions, including the completion of necessary financing\narrangements.\n    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or\n51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.\n    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to\nprovide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in\nsubordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.\n    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with\ncommercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the\nfinancing required to complete the transaction.\n    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in\nthe merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying\ncash interest after five years.\n    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option\nfor the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at\n102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.\n    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity\nof 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in\nthe 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before\nmaturity.\n    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50\ndlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per\nshare. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first\nconvert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.\n    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its\npoison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,\neffective immediately.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Thailand's state\noil company <Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a\nmajor stake in the field.\n    PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to\nconsider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.\n    PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with\nTexas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's\nholdings in the field.\n    \"PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.\nWhen this is done, we have said we are interested in taking\nover a 30 pct share in the field,\" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen\ntold Reuters.\n    Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal\nof the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has\nestimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost\nof some 700 mln crowns.\n    Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower\nreserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little\ninterest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its\nupgraded reserve estimate for the field.\n    The field's reserves could be sold domestically through\nThailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to\nelectricity, the sources said.\n    Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's\n(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force\nthe government to water down its controversial proposal for a\nfive pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating\nthe economy, private economists said.\n    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local\nconstituencies will weaken the government's ability to push\nthrough its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the\nbudget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be\npassed soon, they said.\n    Without the budget, the government would also be\nhard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate\nthe economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in\nlate February and in Washington last week, they said.\n    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled\nparliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the\ngovernment to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early\nthis month.\n    \"The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on\nthe already faltering economy,\" said Johsen Takahashi, chief\neconomist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.\n    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was\npublic discontent with the government's high-handed push for\ntax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with\neconomic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.\n    \"This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in\nthe most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and\nHokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are\nsuffering heavily from the yen's extended rise,\" he said.\n    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of\nthe sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting\ndate of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.\n    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido also said\nhe favours watering down the proposed sales tax while\nsuggesting the government boost public works spending by\nmodifying its tight fiscal policies.\n    \"The local election results were a signal the economy now\nneeds government action to take clear-cut fiscal measures,\" he\nsaid, adding that such moves would help the world economy as\nwell as Japan's.\n    For the last five years or so, the government has stuck to\na tight fiscal policy in a bid to halt the issue of deficit\nfinancing bonds by fiscal 1990/91, economists said.\n    If the LDP election setback leads to a scaled down sales\ntax proposal, the government would have to find other revenue\nsources to help finance the planned tax cuts and a package of\nmeasures to stimulate the economy, the economists said.\n    Koido said the government could raise additional revenue by\nselling shares in public corporations such as Nippon Telegraph\nand Telephone Corp. But it should issue additional bonds to\nensure a more stable source of funds, he said.\n    \"It may run counter to its avowed policy of balancing the\nbudget, but it can do so on a short-term basis,\" he said.\n    Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the need\nfor the government to float more bonds to raise funds needed\nfor economic expansion.\n    He said additional government borrowing would place no\nburden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excess\nfunds and government bond prices have risen to record levels\nlately.\n    \"The market is just waiting for more new government bond\nissues,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The net tax relief from\nthe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.\n    However, the institutes criticised the government, not only\nfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question of\nits financing had been left open.\n    The government has not specified how the remaining 19\nbillion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,\nthough it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.\n    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had\ncaused uncertainty among companies and households as to what\nexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a\nquick decision from the government.\n    They also said the government should reduce tax\npreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a\nrestriction of state spending and called for no increase in\nvalue-added tax.\n    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing\nsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.\n    They referred specifically to a doubling of special\nwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a\npackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this\nas an increase in subsidies.\n    The institutes said total subsidies, including tax\npreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen\nfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it\nshould be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to\nfinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.\n    The institutes said that if the government raised value\nadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the\npositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.\n    The report also noted that the government was progressing\nonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and\nsaid more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim\nfor more competition, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community (EC) has\neffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its\nmarket to imports before it decides on possible tough\nretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.\n    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26\nto review the state of trade relations between the two sides.\n    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of\nmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC\npledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are\n\"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"\n    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing\nstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese\nexports.\n    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be\ndiscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers\non April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare\nproposals for possible retaliatory action.\n    They said the commission has powers to take some limited\naction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese\nexports of electrical, photographic and other goods being\ndiverted to Europe in the wake of possible U.S. Tariff moves.\n    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to\nprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a\nresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges\nthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.\n    Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the Community has\ngrown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in\nMarch.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A takeover battle began today for\ndebt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada\nPipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and\nDome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.\n    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential\nbuyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70\npct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>\nwhich is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd\n<CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.\n    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another\nproposal from \"a substantial company\" and discussions with a\nthird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a\nstatement.\n    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,\nbut did not identify the companies involved in talks.\n    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline\noperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common\nand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which\nwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer\nis to Dome management, not to shareholders.\n    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,\ntotalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.\nIt also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement \"violated\nthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered\ninto with prospective purchasers\" and was apparently timed to\nprevent Dome from considering other proposals.\n    It said the TransCanada bid \"seems to require favourable and\nsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal and\nprovincial governments.\" But Dome added that its management and\nfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals.\n    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he\nwas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied\nthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. \"I find (Dome's\nstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to\nauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce\nit,\" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the\nother bidders, or the terms of other offers.\n    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the\nToronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at\n5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In the prefectural assembly elections to\nfill 2,670 seats, the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously\nheld 1,487 seats to the socialists and communists.\n    Full election results should be available later today.\n    Discussing the election results with reporters, Nakasone\nsaid, \"I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no\neffect at all, but there were other factors, such as a low\nturnout and unusually cold weather.\"\n    The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the\n13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while the\nprefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct, also a\nrecord low.\n    Noboru Goto, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and\nIndustry and a longtime friend of Nakasone, told reporters the\nimpact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.\n    \"The government should take action (on the sales tax) in\nregard to the people's wishes,\" Goto said.\n    Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a\ndelay in the implementation of the tax, which had been\nscheduled for next January, and a possible cut in the rate.\n    \"The most important thing now is to get parliamentary\napproval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid\nappreciation of the yen,\" Nakasone said. \"We must implement\nmeasures to prop up the economy.\"\n    Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum on\nthe tax and they will continue to demand its retraction.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Everyone is stunned by the decision\n(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it.\"\n    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding\neurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total\nborrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.\n    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar\nstraights - had been trading \"basis only\" for some time prior to\nthis weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way\nprice for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any\ntrades would be negotiated.\n    He said that recently there appeared to have been some\nspeculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European\ninvestors had been overall sellers.\n    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders\nwill receive no interest payments.\n    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible\ninto Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading\ndid not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer\nsaid, \"We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing.\"\nTexaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from\nhaving to post the court bond.\n    Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter\nshare dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with\nFriday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.\n    Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared\nwith Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The officials, most of them\neconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.\n    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising\nrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined\nonly 11 pct against the yen.?\n    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely\ninterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar\nmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?\n    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can\nonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.\n    \"I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,\" said Hugh\nRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.\n    \"What I do know is that Community exporters are making a\nhell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there\nis money to be made in Japan,\" he added.\n    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.\nExports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade\npractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as\nagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable\nchecking and customs procedures for car imports.\n    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the\nface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they\nblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.\n    \"We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,\"\nsaid a senior official, who declined to be named. \"We like to\nrefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.\"\n    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the\nKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita\nrepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to\nunderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. \"The real\nissue is the inability of major sectors of American and\nEuropean industry to compete not only internationally but even\nin their home markets,\" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz\nBank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.\nREUTER...^M\n\u0003",

The other two saw only one pct\ngrowth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.\n    Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority,\nsees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for\nexports expressed by the minority.\"\n    He said there was reason to believe that export demand\nwould start to rise in the course of the year, partly because\nof a further increase in world trade.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Nakasone is expected to seek an end\nto Japanese-U.S. Trade disputes which are hurting investor\nconfidence.\n    \"Until we see some concerted effort by the Japanese to halt\nthe yen's rise against the dollar and settle trade disputes,\nthe market will stay low,\" said head of equities at Jardine\nFleming Securities Co, Mario Malt.\n    Malt said current talks between the countries were\ninflammatory and damaged stockmarket optimism.\n    Brokers also said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic\nParty has to show it still rules, after Sunday's nationwide\nlocal elections showed dwindling support.\n    \"It raises doubts on whether the LDP can push through the\nreforms it planned for this year,\" said one broker.\n    Top policy priorities this year are deregulation of\nfinancial activities, stimulation of domestic demand to boost\nimports and removal of agricultural subsidies.\n    If these policies are abandoned or scaled down, stockmarket\ninvestors will have few reasons to buy stocks, brokers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Top officials of leading industrial\nnations appear deeply worried that financial markets have\nignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they\nbelieve they strengthened in talks last week.\n    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the\nmarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely\ndisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the\npolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,\nJapan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to\nreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a\nstatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur\nunderscored that by saying: \"I don't believe at all that the\nAmericans want a weaker dollar.\"\n    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the\ndollar's latest rapid descent \"involves the risk -- now already\na tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,\nleading to a renewed rise in interest rates.\"\n    But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared\nthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they\ncould do until the economic picture changed, and currencies\nsettled into a stable pattern as a result.\n    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's\nsemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher\nU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid\ndescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\ntelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\nthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n    \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\nadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\ndrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\ndollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\nartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\nnot healthy.\"\n    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\nrecession, he said.\n    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\nlife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\nor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\nmight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\nunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n    \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\nare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\nagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\nwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\ndecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\nstabilizing currencies at current levels.\n    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\nto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\nprotectionism.\n    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\ndomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\npromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\naction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\ncurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\nthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n    The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\nbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\nthe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\nagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\nwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\nview that around current levels their currencies are within\nranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\nstatement read.\n    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\nfocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\nTrade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\nrather than prospective policy changes. European monetary\nsources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant\nbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome\nPetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>\nmay short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door\nfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.\n    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt\nof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim\ndebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer\nsubstantial payments to creditors will expire.\n    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders\nthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.\n    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as\npublic noteholders in March after several months of delicate\nnegotiations.\n    TransCanada's proposal \"amounts to a quasi debt\nrestructuring,\" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker\nLtd said from Toronto.\n    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow\ncreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet\nto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to\ncash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.\n    \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that\neven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that\nDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"\nsaid Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in\nCalgary.\n    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome\nwas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed\nrefinancing packages, Gobert said.\n    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome\nsince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders\nto agree to a restructuring, he added.\n    \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain\nany and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.\n    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that\nTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix\nthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other\npossible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to\nus in our discussions, it means that others may be a little\nreluctant to come forward,\" he said.\n    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal\noffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a\nconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.\n    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions\nwith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other\nunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and\nfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including\nTransCanada's.\n    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price\nfor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.\n    However, he said not enough financial details are known\nabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of\nTransCanada's proposed offer.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In late March, Sosnoff said he\nhad received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to the\noffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.\n    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln\ncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a\nprimary basis.\n    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan\nas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders\nwould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject\nto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in\nJune.\n    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln\ndlrs in debt to finance the payout.\n    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the\namended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to\ngive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on\nthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New\nJersey and Nevada gaming authorities.\n    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all\nof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a\nmerger transaction.\n    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares\nhe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,\nwould give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.\n    He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number of\nshares in response to his tender.\n    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in\nthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April\n8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to\nincrease the price of his offer.\n    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in\nplace.\n    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered\nto him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing\ndividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding\nCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.\n    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a\nsyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr\nmargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for\nfurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up to\nan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the\npurchase of shares under the offer.\n    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,\neach of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,\nor 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into\nSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an\nindependent investment baking firm.\n    He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares\nare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a\ncombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value\nof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\"\n    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to\nCaesars' recapitalization.\n    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming\nofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory\nprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that it\nalready underway in New Jersey.\n    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely\nduration of the regulatory process.\n    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the\napproval process is not completed by the expiration date.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Leaders of the nation's unionized\nautomobile workers have signaled their intent for a major work\nstoppage later this year if General Motors Corp. <GM> and Ford\nMotor Co. <F>  fail to satisfy demands for job security, pay\nraises and protection against shifting U.S. production to\nforeign sources.\n    United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber was\nloudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special\nbargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the\n1.1 mln-member union is ready to go to \"war\" against the major\nauto makers in support of its goals.\n    \"It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...\nand if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the\ninsecurity of layoff,\" the UAW chief said.\n    The militant tone as the four-day convention opened\nunderscored the probability for bitter confrontation during the\nsummer's labor negotiations between the UAW and the auto\ncompanies over new contracts covering some 500,000 U.S. workers\nat G.M. and Ford.\n    The current pacts expire September 14.\n    GM Vice President and chief labor negotiator Alfred Warren\nrecently told Reuters that the 1987 bargaining round would\nlikely be the most difficult of the decade because of the\ncarmaker's drive to cut costs and shed uncompetitive\nparts-making operations employing thousands of workers.\n    Job security has been the union's main theme for several\nyears. A master resolution stating UAW goals notes that the\nunion's membership working in the auto industry has fallen by\n200,000 since 1978 to a current level of about 690,000.\n    GM was hit by a six-day selective national strike in 1984\nbefore signing its current labor agreement, which contains a\none billion dlr job security fund to protect workers whose jobs\nare threatened by new technology or moves to outside suppliers.\n    At Ford, which has more than 8 billion dlrs in cash\nreserves and out-earned larger GM last year for the first time\nsince 1924, executives said they would oppose the UAW's demand\nfor a return to guaranteed percentage annual pay increases that\nwere dropped in the last recession.\n    Ford has not been hit by a national strike since 1976,\nwhich has prompted some union analysts to suggest it is now\nFord's \"turn,\" to be the UAW strike target.\n    Bieber yesterday described the UAW's situation in 1987 as\n\"crucial\" in view of the growing penetration of the U.S. market\nby imported cars and trucks as well as moves by the Detroit\nautomakers to use foreign and other non-union sources to secure\ncheaper vehicles and auto parts.\n    He said the union will stress job security, annual general\npay raises, improved profit-sharing and limits on companies'\nability to transfer work.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Portugal's economy, which has been\nenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,\nmay now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest\ngovernment crisis, analysts said.\n    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco\nSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investment\nas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European\nCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.\n    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was\ntoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.\n    The centre-right administration had made economic growth\nreform a priority in its 17 months in office.\n    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current\naccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and\ninflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.\n    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability\nwere worrying but they felt the foundations for continued\ngrowth had not been badly shaken.\n    \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is\nnow less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz\nHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.\n    \"The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist\nJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.\n    Businessmen have identified political instability over the\nlast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting\neconomic progress.\n    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974\nrevolution.\n    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain\nbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge\nin economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely\nunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.\n    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of\nPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,\npredicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth\nwould remain at similar levels this year.\n    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies\nand could slow economic development.\n    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end\nof the month, can either call early elections or form a new\ngovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominated\nparliament.\n    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick\nelections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a\nmajority government could result from early elections,\"\nConfederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro\nFerraz da Costa said.\n    He said they were optimistic this could mean the\ncontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policies\nintroduced over the last year.\n    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but\nthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls\nsay they could win an overall majority.\n    A PSD majority would also open the way for more\nwide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and\npossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.\n    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties\nof blocking key economic reforms.\n    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results\nwere more the product of favourable international conditions\nsuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD\npolicies.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Columbia Gas Transmission\ncorp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if\nits costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.\n    Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary\nsaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a\nproposal to include these costs in the company's most recent\npurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.\n    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial\nruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative\nfiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to\ninclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or\nconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing\nand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.\n    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover\nabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales\ncommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on\nrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,\nbeginning April 1, 1987.\n    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline\ncommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.\n    The company said it orginially sought to include these\ncosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in\nalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were\nnot related to take-or-pay buyout costs.\n    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April\n10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay\nbuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing\nunder the Natural Gas Act.\n    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,\nColumbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price\npaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs\nper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April\n1985.\n    The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct\nof its total available gas supply this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc.'s plunge into bankruptcy to\nshield it from posting a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr legal\nbattle with Pennzoil Co. <PZL> is a strategy that will give it\nbreathing room until the fight over the 1984 acquisition of\nGetty Oil Co. winds its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court,\nanalysts said.\n    Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, filed for\nprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code earlier\ntoday, saying it had no choice because of Pennzoil's refusal to\nnegotiate a reasonable settlement.\n    But unlike most Chapter 11 cases, the Texaco proceeding\nshould not result in a major reorganization of the company or\naffect its daily business operations, several experts said.\n    \"This is another piece of financial history,\" Sanford\nMargoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said of\nthe bankruptcy filing. \"What Texaco is doing is buying time to\nfight its battle in the courts. They have high hopes they will\nbe upheld if the case goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt.\"\n    Margoshes said he did not anticipate any significant\nchanges in Texaco's oil exploration and production business\nbecause the bankruptcy filing affects only about four pct of\nthe giant oil company's 32.6 billion dlrs in annual revenues.\n    Texaco executives said the bankruptcy filing would\neffectively halt payments of stock dividends and repayment of\nits 6.8 billion dlr debt, but added that the company's assets\nfar exceeded its liabilities.\n    \"Texaco's cash flow is at a very respectable rate of about\n15 dlrs per share annually,\" Margoshes said. \"Obviously, the\npoint of Chapter 11 was not so much seeking protection from\ncreditors as it was seeking protection from the predator\nPennzoil.\"\n    The two companies have been locked in an acrimonious\nstruggle since a Texas state court jury in November 1985\nordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil 10.53 billion dlrs for\nimproperly interfering with Pennzoil's planned acquisition of\nGetty Oil Co. In a major setback for Texaco last week, the U.S.\nSupreme Court said Texaco must abide by Texas state law that\nrequires posting a bond for the full amount of the judgment\nwhile the merits of the case were appealed.\n    Although a Texas appeals court hearing was scheduled Monday\n(April 13) on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of the bond\nrequired under state law, Texaco elected not to risk losing the\nimportant court ruling that could have required it to post more\nthan 10 billion dlrs in collateral.\n    The bankruptcy filing, analysts said, effectively freezes\nall of Texaco's obligations while it continues to appeal the\nmerits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.\n    \"This is a drastic measure,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, an\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild in New York. \"But it's also an\nindictment of the legal system in this country in that Texaco\nwas forced to seek bankruptcy when it couldn't get a fair\nhearing.\"\n    Ilacqua predicted that the Texas jury judgment would\nultimately be overturned or whittled down from its original\n10.53 billion dlrs, an amount that is increasing by about 2.5\nmln dlrs in interest accumulated daily. Texaco has contested\nthe ruling, insisting that Pennzoil did not have a valid\ncontract under New York state law to acquire Getty Oil.\n    Suggestions by some experts that the Texaco bankruptcy\nmight be an incentive for Pennzoil to lower its settlement\ndemands, which are widely believed to be between 3 billion and\n5 billion dlrs, were discounted by indignant Pennzoil\nexecutives.\n    \"I think it makes it much more difficult to settle,\" said\nBaine Kerr, Pennzoil's retired president who has acted as the\ncompany's chief negotiator in the Texaco litigation. \"I think\nthat's one of the main reasons they did it.\"\n    Joseph Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the\ncompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on\nSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for\nbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal,\nciting a confidentiality agreement between the two companies.\n    \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they\nchose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said. \"This was an\nirresponsible and unneeded move.\"\n    Ilacqua also said the bankruptcy filing appeared to\neliminate any chance of settlement in the near-term.\n    \"There have been some crazy numbers floating around in\nsettlement discussions,\" Ilacqua said. \"I think 1 billion dlr\nsettlement would be more than adequate for Pennzoil. I don't\nknow if that Texas jury really understood what money is. They\ngave Pennzoil an astronomical judgment.\"\n    Analysts said they expected Texaco stock, which closed\nFriday at 31 and 7/8, to slip to about 25 when the New York\nStock Exchange opened Monday morning.\n    Lawyers for Pennzoil said they believed the company would\nprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were\nample enough to ultimately pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community (EC) has\neffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its\nmarket to imports before it decides on possible tough\nretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.\n    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26\nto review the state of trade relations between the two sides.\n    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of\nmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC\npledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are\n\"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"\n    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing\nstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese\nexports.\n    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be\ndiscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers\non April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare\nproposals for possible retaliatory action.\n    They said the commission has powers to take some limited\naction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese\nexports of electrical, photographic and other goods being\ndiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.\n    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to\nprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a\nresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges\nthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.\n    Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown\nsteadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But experience has\nshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price\nrise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.\n    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may\nseem exaggerated, they said.\n    \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price\nclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into\na restrictive policy,\" they said.\n    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are\nless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.\n    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary\nexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic\ninvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital market\ninvestments following lower interest rates.\n    \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of\ncentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a\nsmaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.\n    A return to growth and stability did not require\nspectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with\nopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid\nan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.\n    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be\nfocused simply on growth of production potential. Because of\nuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic\nweakness other factors should be taken into account.\n    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts\nand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation\nspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat\nin itself to price stability.\n    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth\nreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the\nfalling mark.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The price change was decided upon\nlast week and will be effective today, he said.\n    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums\non high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat\nprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein\npremium would remain unchanged.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\ncompany's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.\n    Montgomery further told the conference, \"Don't be an\ninvestor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery\nin operating or net income in 1987 and 1988.\"\n    \"Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market\nshare in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of\nthe impact to the bottom line,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform of\nits financial system with a package of measures designed to\nboost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrative\nworld of investment banking.\n    Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift in\npolicy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying\ncontradiction between an Islamic legal framework and western\nbanking system.\n    One senior banker in Jeddah said: \"There is a new wind\nblowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner\nthat is extraordinarily aggressive.\"\n    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering\npace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a\nfinancial system that restricted internationalisation of the\nriyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting\ndifficult.\n    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have\ngenerally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth\nsuccessive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into\nalready dwindling earnings.\n    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy\nalthough it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.\n    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously\ndormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.\n    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,\ngiving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase\nagreements.\n    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished\nwithholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.\n    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new\ncommittee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank\ndisputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.\n    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use\nmortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.\n    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market\ntrading floor is expected to be opened.\n    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi\nIndustrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used\nto trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11\ncommercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a\nnew computer network has been set up.\n    One banker said: \"The abolition of withholding tax will give\nbanks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as\ninterest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance\nMinistry are opening up markets for investment banking.\"\n    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked\ninto reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance\nto extend further loans to the private sector.\n    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the\nreligious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the\nKingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible\nfor them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.\n    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,\nbut found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a\nseries of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively\nexpensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.\n    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill\nin bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the\nmountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant\nfamilies also called for change, bankers said.\n    \"Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force\nchange -- they stopped lending,\" another banker said. \"That was\nstifling growth of the economy.\"\n    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be\nset up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more\nefficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the\nCommittees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).\n    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,\nwill simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series\nof private deals with creditors.\n    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on\ninterest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.\n    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA\nand the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were\nnot the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.\n    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.\nFinance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a\nnew body would examine late government payments to contractors.\n    In addition, further moves are under way to align business\nlife to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged\nto adopt it as their financial year.\n    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago\nby banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,\nbankers say.\n    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities\ntransactions with any party on the list.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

J. Baker, a lawyer representing Texaco, told reporters\nthat the nation's third largest oil company was forced to seek\nbankruptcy protection because of its precarious fianncial\ncondition and problems with suplliers and bankers stemming from\nthe 10.53 billion dlr judgement.\n    \"All activity after the filing can be conducted on normal\nbusiness terms,\" Baker said.\n    He said Texaco would seek permission from the court to\ncontinue its appeal in Texas courts of the Pennzoil judgement.\n    \"There will be no bond required because all state court\nlitigation has been stayed,\" Baker said.\n    When asked whether Texaco's reorganization plan would\ninclude major restructuring of the company, Baker declined to\nsay what the eventual plan might include.\n    \"I think Texaco will succesfully complete its Chapter 11\nproceedings and have a reorganization plan approved by the\ncourt,\" he said.\n    Baker said Texaco expected Pennzoil to seek a seat on a\ncreditors' committee to be appointed by the bankruptcy courts\nbut added he did not know whether Texaco would oppose such an\nattempt.\n    Lawyers for both sides also said that each company\ncontinued to be interested in a possible settlement, but\ndeclined to say whether any negotiations were scheduled between\nthe two companies.\n    \"Texaco has tried to settle and will continue and try and\nsettle,\" Baker said.\n    The two companies reportedly remain far apart in what each\nconsiders to be a fair settlement, with Pennzoil seeking\nbetween three and five billion dlrs, while Texaco has\nmaintained it cannot pay more than about one billion dlrs,\naccording to analysts.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Pentland Industries PLC said it report\na substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its\nholdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its\nstake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct.\n     It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln\nshares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and\nPentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in\nReebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.\n    After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares\noutstanding.\n    Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale\ndepends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be\nnegotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling\nstockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok\ncommon, and the underwriters.\n    Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by\nReebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA\nGroup for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok\nwill have bank credit lines available for general corporate\npurposes, including possible acquisitions.\n    Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that\nprice, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth\nabout 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are\nworth about 136.5 mln dlrs.\n    Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and\npossible acquisitions.\n    Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in\nthe U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and\n1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an\ninternational syndicate led by Kidder.\n    It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option\nto buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional\n900,000 shares to cover overallotments. Pentland said it has\nnot chosen to participate in this over allotment.\n    Pentland said that as soon as the date and price of the\noffering have been determined it will release further details.\n    It said it expects the offering to close in May.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc's decision to file for\nprotection under the bankruptcy code had a chilling effect on\nits stock, and sent Pennzoil Co's shares sharply lower as well,\ntraders said.\n    Texaco dropped 3-1/2 to 28-3/8 and Pennzoil fell 12-7/8 to\n79-3/8.\n    \"A lot of people had bid up Pennzoil, expecting a\nsettlement of two to five billion dlrs in this case,\" energy\nanalyst Rosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said, \"and now\nnobody knows where this is going to settle out.\"\n    \"It seems to me that the hope of an out of court settlement\nin this long running court case had a greater relative impact\non Pennzoil's stock then on Texaco's,\" analyst Sanford\nMargoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said, citing the sharper\ndecline in Pennzoil this morning.\n    The litigation arose when Pennzoil sued Texaco for\ninterfering in its 1984 agreement to acquire Getty Oil. In\n1985, a Texas state court ruled in favor of Pennzoil and\nordered Texaco to pay 10.53 billion dlrs in damages.\n    Citing the burden of the court case and a Supreme Court\nruling last week in favor of Pennzoil concerning the amount\nTexaco must put up as a bond while appealing the case, Texaco\nfiled for the Chapter 11 protection on Sunday.\n    \"That decision puts Pennzoil in the unsecured creditor\ncatagory and that means they have lost their preferred\nposition, which is causing the most damage to the stock today,\"\nMargoshes said. \"They will only be able to collect payment\nafter secured creditors have collected,\" he said.\n    \"From the standpoint of the attractiveness of Texaco's\nstock,\" Margoshes said, \"I have turned quite bullish.\"\n    \"I think there is an overreaction in the downside of the\n(Texaco) stock today, with some investors believing that Texaco\ncannot effectively conduct its business. But only Texaco Inc\nand two subsidiaries are under protection, and there is no\nindication that they will not be able to proceed adequately,\"\nMargoshes said. In addition, he noted, \"there are insitutions\nthat just cannot legally--according to their own\nregulations--hold a stock that is in bankruptcy. That caused\nmuch of the selling at the opening,\" he said.\n    L.F. Rothschild's Ilacqua said \"you have to wonder if an\ninterim settlement can be reached between the two or if this\nthing is going to go the full legal route, and that is what\ninvestment decisions hinge on.\"\n    He said \"if this whole thing settles with Texaco owing a\nlot less than the 10 billion dlrs, speculating in Texaco stock\ncould be quite interesting.\" He expects the stock to trade 25\ndlr to 30 dlr a share range for as long as it takes for a\ndecision to made in the case.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It said Stearn's president\nand controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not\nknow the names of the president and controller, and could not\nimmediately comment on the release.\n    Foster said the amount involved in the \"discrepancy\" is\nabout 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net\nafter tax due to an \"improper recording of job costs over a\nperiod of several years and continuing through part of the\nfirst quarter of 1987.\"\n    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.\nThe company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not\n\"likely to be significant\" but the amount to be charged to\nprior periods had not been determined.\n    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln\ndlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.\n    Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage\nconveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.\n    Foster, a diversified international concern with 27\nsubsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New\nJersey.

It\nwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78\nbillion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.\n    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of\na 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of\ntrade talks with U.S. Officials.\n    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last\nnight he was leaving with \"a heavy heart,\" meaning that he would\nface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist\nsentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus\nwith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.\n    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.\nCalls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,\npurchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,\nimport tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.\n    \"I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from\nour talks with the U.S.,\" he said without elaborating.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Despite a sharp early fall in Texaco\nInc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market was\nlargely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protection\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.\n    \"Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bond\nprices this morning. It should not spill over to the overall\nmarket like LTV Corp's <LTV> bankruptcy filing did last\nsummer,\" said one analyst.\n    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 points\nthis morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.\n    \"Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down its\npaper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face\nvalue) from around 95 Friday,\" said a dealer in high-yield, low\nrated bonds.\n    \"But sellers could not be found at those levels and the\nbids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area,\" he added, referring\nto such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of\n1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.\n    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corp\ndowngraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt of\nTexaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.\n    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agency\nsaid it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies in\nChapter 11 reorganization.\n    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting most\nof the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.\n    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturn\nlast summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries that\ncredit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.\n    \"This is clearly not the case with Texaco,\" said one\ntrader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have lately\noutperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.\n    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco's\nbankruptcy filing as a defensive move.\n    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said the\nbankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation under\nTexas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation\nagainst Pennzoil Co <PZL>.\n    \"The filing was not the result of credit weakness. The\ncompany got through the oil crisis alright,\" said one portfolio\nmanager.\n    Others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with that\nassessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Dollar issues\ntotalled 6.8 billion dlrs, accounting for only 35 pct of total\nofferings, but borrowing was particularly heavy on the euroyen\nmarket (3.3 billion dlrs) and in sterling (2.8 billion dlrs).\n    Offerings of mark bonds declined to 1.3 billion dlrs from\naround three billion dlrs in the two previous months, whilst\nstrong advances were recorded in the euro-Australian and\neuro-Canadian dollar sectors, where new offerings exceeded one\nbillion dlrs, the OECD said.\n    In the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loans\nfell to 2.4 billion dlrs in March from 4.2 billion in February.\nSimilarly, activity on the market for note issuance and other\nback-up facilities fell to one billion dlrs from 1.5 billion.\n    In March, OECD borrowers accounted for over 90 pct of total\nborrowing. Japan was the largest fund-raiser with 4.5 billion\ndlrs, followed by the U.S. With 3.9 billion and Britain with\n2.4 billion dlrs.\n    France, West Germany and Norway raised funds of over one\nbillion dlrs each.\n    Borrowing by developing countries totalled one billion\ndlrs, about the same amount as in February.

        "body": "Chemical New York Corp said its\nfirst-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed\n1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.\n    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln\ndlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the\nBrazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in\nlost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.\n    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs\nfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was\nmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in\nconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.\n    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,\nChemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or\n4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.\n    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of\nmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not\nresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the\nwhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.\n    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on\nnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspended\ninterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest\nincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.\n    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs\nfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from\n3.96 pct.\n    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a\nreduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation\nof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and\na narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's\ncost of funds.\n    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from\n27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs\nfrom 26.2 mln.\n    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5\nmln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.\n    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared\nwith 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7\nmln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at\nquarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with\n594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.\n    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion\ndlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35\nbillion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of\nMarch, 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts\nwill not be required to underwrite the government's offering of\nits securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the\nBank of England said.\n    In an official notice released today, the Bank said \"There\nwill be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the\nauctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,\nas part of their commitment to the market, to participate\nactively in the auction process.\"\n    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring\nthe dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after\nthose in the U.S. Treasury market.\n    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the\nrequest by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission\nwhich would discourage the largest institutional investors from\nplacing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of\nEngland, thus denying primary dealers some of their best\ncustomers. Commission would have been passed along to customers\nwho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less\nexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.\n    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with\nthe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the\nallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a\nconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of\nmarket conditions.\n    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be\ndisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with\nthe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any\nconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned\nor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient\nor unwieldy.\n    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first\nauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional\nshort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.\n    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial\nyear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated\nstock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to\none billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in\nmaturity.\n    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be\nmet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government\nbroker.\n    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the\nBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a\n28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock\nof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling\nthe stock once the fallow period expires.\n    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold\nare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank\nwill agree to take the stock onto its own books.\n    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the\nfallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender\nprice.\n    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will\nbe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders\nare allotted stock at the price which they bid.\n    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any\nmoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single\nauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about\npreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to\ndrive the price up.\n   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent\ndealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing\nadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.\n    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the\nauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,\nwhich is widely expected to be on the same day.\n    Information to be released will include the amount of stock\nallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,\nand the highest, lowest and average price of the successful\nbids.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

At March 31, the allowance for loan losses\nwas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.\n    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the\nend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs\nof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.\n    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for\nthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced\nby about 4.9 mln dlrs.\n    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof National Westminster Bank PLC.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

War against the\ninsecurity of layoff,\" the UAW chief said.\n    In a 101-page document proposing its 1987 collective\nbargaining program, the leadership of the 1.1 mln member union\nurged \"full resumption of our traditional wage formula\" as \"a\ntop priority in this round of bargaining.\"\n    But the union concedes that increased foreign competition,\nnew technology and shifts to low-cost offshore production by\nU.S. manufacturers will continue to cut the number of workers\nin the motor vehicle and agricultural equipment industries.\n    Union leaders told Reuters the 1987 round of bargaining\nwith GM and Ford will be one of the most difficult in the\n51-year history of the union in view of GM's announced goal to\nclose plants it deems non-competitive and to increase its\npurchase of parts from outside suppliers as part of a massive\nprogram to reduce its costs by 10 billion dlrs and reverse the\nprofits decline it suffered the last two years.\n    At Ford, where a record 3.3 billion dlrs in profits last\nyear swelled its cash reserves past eight billion dlrs,\nanalysts say the company's healthy position could make it a\ntempting target for the union in its drive to increase wages.\n    Labor executives for both GM and Ford have said they will\noppose any attempt to return to annual general wage increases\nthat were dropped in 1982 when the Detroit-based industry was\nmired in a deep recession.\n    But the UAW, pointing to a three pct pay increase to be\nimplemented later this year in the contract it negotiated with\nChrysler Corp after a 1985 strike, said it intends to seek full\nreinstatement of annual percentage wage increases in this\nyear's bargaining with GM and Ford.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full\nrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be\nfelt until later in the year.\n    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer\nline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,\nwhich will begin volume shipments in July.\n    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its\nearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will\nemerge as the year progresses.\n    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was\nrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than\nhe has been for nearly a year.\n    \"Although the worldwide economic situation remains\nunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,\"\nAkers said, pointing to, among other things, higher\nfirst-quarter shipments. \"We remain optimistic about the\nprospects for both the industry and IBM,\" he said.\n    \"Akers was most encouraging,\" said PaineWebber's Smith.\n    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe\ncomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected\nfirst-quarter results, analysts said.\n    \"Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in\nMarch,\" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of\nWashington-based Weil and Associates.\n    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called\nthe Sierras, \"bailed out the whole quarter,\" Weil said, adding,\n\"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.\"\nREUTER...^M\n\u0003",

In the\nsame year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a\nshare from continuing operations.\n    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying\nCeleron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.\n    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost\ncomplete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,\nCalif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves\nwould not be sold separately from the pipeline.\n    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for\nCeleron was too high, Mercer said \"There is no fire sale going\non here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable\noperation throughout the year.\"\n    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was\nbased on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase\nlast year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover\nbid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The dollar straight sector of the\neurobond market ended lower after another nervous day's\ntrading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead of\ntomorrow's U.S. Trade figures for February, dealers said.\nPrices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower,\nwhile short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.\n    Bonds for Texaco Inc units hardly traded during the day\nfollowing the weekend news that the company filed for Chapter\n11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long running\ndispute with Pennzoil Co, dealers added.\n    The Chapter 11 filing means that Texaco will not be paying\ninterest on its eurobonds. Dealers in the straight bonds noted\nthat the market in them had been basis only for some time prior\nto the weekend's news. \"It wasn't a true market, someone asked\nyou a price and you just gave them an idea,\" one said.\n    However, the company's convertible bonds had been trading\nsince the company's share price provided a benchmark to which\ndealers could establish a proper price level. The company has\ntwo actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlr\nbond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal,\nalso due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.\n    Traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels for\nthe convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to\n99 pct. Today, one trader said they were indicated initially at\n65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.\n    But he added, \"That's only an idea. There's no real market\ntoday. I've dealt once during the day, I'm not going to say at\nwhat level.\" Other dealers were reluctant even to give an\nindication of the bonds' levels.\n    Dealers said the market in all Texaco deals will almost\ncertainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis until\nthe events of the weekend are further clarified.\n    The primary market had a steady day, with the Australian\ndollar and the yen sectors again seeing the most activity,\ndealers said. Deutsche Bank Finance NV Curacao became the first\nof three issuers in the Australian dollar market during the\nmorning with a 100 mln dlr bond due 1990 paying 14-1/8 pct and\npriced at 100-1/4 pct.\n    The issue was lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets\n(DBCM) and guaranteed by Deutsche Bank itself. A DBCM official\nsaid the firm had placed 60 mln Australian dlrs of the issue\nitself and quoted the deal at less one less 7/8 pct,\ncomfortably inside the 1-1/2 pct total fees.\n    The State Bank of Victoria issued a 50 mln Australian dlr\nbond paying 14-1/2 pct over three years and priced at 101-3/8\npct. Commerzbank AG was sole manager for the deal, which was\noffered on one broker screen at less 1-1/2 pct.\n    The day's other borrower in this sector was the New South\nWales Treasury Corporation guaranteed by the crown-in-right of\nNew South Wales. The five year bond pays 14-1/4 pct and was\npriced at 101-7/8 pct.\n    Lead manager was County Natwest Capital Markets. It was\nquoted at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct, inside the two pct total\nfees.\n    Secondary market Australian dlr bonds ended little changed\non the day, with dealers saying that operators are awaiting the\nAustralian trade figures for March. A deficit of some 800 mln\nto one billion dlrs was expected by one house active in the\nsector.\n    Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd lead managed a\n15 billion yen bond for Union Bank of Switzerland NV. The five\nyear deal pays 4-3/8 pct and features a put and call option at\npar after four years.\n    Priced at 101-5/8 pct, the issue was quoted at less 1-1/4\npct bid on the grey market compared with the total fees of\n1-5/8 pct.\n    Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica issued a 15 billion\nyen bond due 1994 at 4-3/4 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct. The\ndeal was quoted on the 1-7/8 pct total fees.\n    Elsewhere, Alza Corp issued a 75 mln dlr convertible bond\ndue 2002 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The par priced\nissue has an indicated coupon of between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner\nCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to\nbe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.\n     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for\n4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch\nCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for\n89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and\nsecurities for the balance.\n    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.\n    \"I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in\nwith another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at\n51 or 52 dlrs per share.\n    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of\nBorg-Warner's stock.\n    \"You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up\nthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have\nto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking\nat it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard\nHenderson said.\n    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.\n    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill\nLynch officials did not return phone calls.\n    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\nsought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\nbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things as\ntelephones, computer terminals, and appliances.\n    \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical\noperation these days,\" said Henderson.\n    \"He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he\ndoes not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson.\n    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover\nof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF\ndid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its\ninvestment in Carbide.\n    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its\nBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer\nand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would\ngive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.\n    \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst.\n    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be\nforthcoming shortly.\n    \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this\nbook,\" he said.\n    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,\nprotective services, which includes Wells Fargo security\nguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.\n    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows\nGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it\nwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per\nshare.\n    \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said\nRose.\n    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman\nwould do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\"\n    \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical\nenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose\nsaid.\n    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add\nearnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as\n50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if\nthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John\nHenry of E.F. Hutton.\n    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986\noperating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion\ndlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net\nearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.\n    \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, adding\nits only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow\nChemical Co <DOW>.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Nearly 50 manufacturers and trade\ngroups asked the Reagan Administration for exclusions from the\ntariffs it is to impose on Japanese exports Friday.\n    Several police agencies also told a special screening panel\nthey wanted a Japanese-made fingerprinting system to be\nexcluded because it was vital for crime-fighting.\n    Another 25 firms are to testify tomorrow.\n    President Reagan announced the tariffs on March 27 to\nretaliate for Japan's failure to honor an agreement to stop\ndumping semiconductors in world markets outside the United\nStates at below cost and to open its own market to U.S. goods.\n    U.S. semiconductor makers had complained they were being\ninjured by Japan's unfair trade practices.\n    The tariffs of 100 pct - up from about five pct - are to be\napplied to 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports including\npower tools, television sets, computer parts and audio\nequipment, in addition to the fingerprinting equipment.\n    Reagan issued a list of several dozen products that could\nbe subject to the tariffs, and businessmen, lobbyists and\nothers asked for the exclusions in the two days of public\ntestimony that began today at the Commerce Department.\n    He said \"action should be taken in such a manner that\nefforts to help the semiconductor industry do not inflict\nextensive economic damage on the highly successful information\ntechnology industry.\"\n    A spokesman for Amdahl Corp <AMH>, a computer maker, said\nit would be hit hard by tariffs on Fujitsu Ltd equipment\nbecause Fujitsu was its only supplier of key electronic\ncomponents.\n    Makita U.S.A., Inc, a maker of hand-held electric power\ntools, said if tariffs were imposed on its goods it would have\nto close its U.S. manufacturing operation in Buford, Ga., and\nlayoff its entire U.S. workforce of 600 people.\n    The U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is conducting\nthe hearings, said the products to be assessed the higher\ntariffs will be made public on Thursday or Friday.\n    It said it would base its judgment on the impact of the\ntariffs on the companies hit as well as on the buying public.\n    Some of the tariffs would double the price of imports.\n    Law officers from California, Illinois, Alaska and\nelsewhere said they relied on NEC Corp of Japan's advanced\nfingerprinting system and asked it be exempt from the new\ntariffs.\n    Fred Wynbrandt, representing the California attorney\ngeneral's office, said the tariffs would double California\nstate and local costs for fingerprinting operations.\n    Many of those testifying backed the idea of retaliatory\ntariffs but not on some goods that would hit their business.\n    Vico Henriques, president of the Computer and Business\nEquipment Manufacturers Association, called for exemptions for\ncomponents that U.S. firms bought in Japan and for goods made\nin Japan under a U.S. license or by a joint venture.\n more\n\u0003",

        "body": "Some of the United States' largest\naerospace firms are competing with some of the world's most\npowerful nations for a chance to cash in on the coming\ncommercialization of space.\n      The newest space race is for contracts to launch\nprivately owned satellites into orbit - a business expected to\nbe worth two billion to five billion dlrs annually in a few\nyears.\n    The growing opportunities to make money in space will be\nhighlighted this month when the U.S. National Oceanic\nAtmospheric Administration seeks lucrative commercial bids to\nlauch future weather satellites, ending its long-standing\ndependence on the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.\n    Companies and countries with established satellite\nlaunching operations may also get a jump on eventually\nproviding other space-based services, particularly if the\nproposed international manned space station is launched as\nplanned in the early 1990s.\n    The 12 billion dlr space station, first proposed by\nPresident Reagan in 1984, could require as many as 16 cargo\ndeliveries a year, many delivered by private firms. The\npartners in the space station are currently slated to be\nCanada, Japan, and the 13-nation European Space Agency, the\nlatter two of which also have or are developing their own\ncommercial space programs.\n     Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986, NASA had a\nvirtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo.\n    But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program, President\nReagan declared last August that future U.S. shuttle flights\nwill no longer carry commercial payloads.\n    The administration's decision left Arianespace, a\nFrench-led European consortium, the only option available to\nsatellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all its\nplanned flights through 1989.\n    The company also raised its prices, from 30,000 dlrs a\nlaunch to 50,000 dlrs, but even the larger price tag did not\ndampen demand. Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year,\ncompared with 11 in 1985.\n    Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalist\ncountries to try and get a piece of the action.\n    China, the Soviet Union and Japan have all announced\nsatellite launch programs and several U.S. firms, including\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp, General Dynamics Corp and Martin\nMarietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next three\nyears to develop their own satellite launch capabilities.\n    There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellite\nlaunches by then, analysts said. Without Challenger, there were\nonly three satellite launches last year, 15 fewer than in 1985\nand the lowest since 1980, when only two were sent up.\n    Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites a\nyear for the next three years, about 75 pct of the world's\nsatellite launches during that period.\n     McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the U.S.\nfirms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pact\nfor up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites.\nThe contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts to\nbuild rockets for private satellite launches.\n      Martin Marietta, however, was the first U.S. company to\nsign up a client, Federal Express Co. Marietta plans to launch\nan ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989.\n    Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titan\nrockets used by the Air Force to other private companies that\nwant to get into the satellite launch buisiness.\n    Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the U.S. companies\nwill probably become the European firm's biggest competitors\nfor satellite launching. He does not expect the national space\nprograms to become commercially viable until the late 1990s.\n    Japan has expanded its space program, launching 38\ngovernment-owned satellites in the last 16 years. But most of\nthem were small and it was only in February it launched its\nfirst satellite that circles the earth over the poles.\n    Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets. The\nsatellite launched in February was placed in orbit by a\nMcDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by the\nJapanese under license.\n    Tsugo Tadakawa, director of the Washington office of\nJapan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA), said Japan\nplans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets, an American Japanese\nhybrid that replaces the Delta, through 1991. Its much larger\nsucessor, the H-II, should be ready by 1992, he said.\n    NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs, Tadakawa\nsaid, about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending.\n    Still, NASDA is free from private competition at home and\nhas the full support of the government, since aerospace was\nchosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of the\ncountry's new industries for the next decade.\n     Surprisingly, the People's Republic of China, a relative\nnewcomer to aerospace, is so far the most successful competitor\nto Ariane.\n    The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only national\nprogram besides the European consortium to win a private\nsatellite contract. It will launch a Westar communications\nsatellite for New-York based Terasat in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

USDA would have to certify that the\nplants had corrected the deficiencies.\n    All remaining plants with a history or potential of\nshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more\nsignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures before\nfurther EC review.\n    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat\nInstitute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal\ntrade retaliation petition by April 30.\n    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft\npetition.\n    An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said\nU.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,\nbut that \"the chances of that are not too good at this time.\"\n    However, there is the \"expectation\" in U.S. government and\nmeat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow\nshipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from\nU.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring\ntheir operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the\nUSTR official said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Major U.S. banks may lift prime\nlending rates again within days due to recent increases in\ntheir borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is\nnudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.\n    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most\nbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to\n7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own\ncost of money. That spread has narrowed again.\n    \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\nsaid Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\njustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\nthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\npercentage point.\n    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\npoints since last October until it fell below one point and\ntriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n    \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\nas this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\n    \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\nnear future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\ncosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\nsaid Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\nbecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\ndemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\nrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\nshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\nsaid \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\nstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\ndollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\nfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\nsaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\nstabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\ninterest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\non Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\nclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\nin the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\nrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\nthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\nmarket than most economists had expected.\n    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\namounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\nwith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\nhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\ntoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\nround of customer repurchase agreements.\n    \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\noffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\nsaid Jones of Lanston.\n    \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\nneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\nmerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\nmajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\novertly at some point.\"\n    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\nbecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\nfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\nwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\nfurther aid the dollar.\n    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\nmay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n    \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\npolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\nsaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\nLeslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\nabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \n Reuter\n\u0003",

In addition,\nHomestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which\nhave not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an\nacquisition, he said.\n    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be\nabout the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said\nexploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than\nlast year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas\nexploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6\npct.\n    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about\nthe same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.\n    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin\nreserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400\nounces due to start-up production problems.\n    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400\nU.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.\n     IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market\nprice for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.\n    Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a\n12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a\nspecific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released\nin 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Williams, in an oral ruling, said FMC\nhad not been harmed by trading in FMC stock by Boesky and other\ntraders prior to FMC's two-billion dlr recapitalization last\nyear.\n    FMC had claimed insider trading by Boesky had forced it to\nincrease the value of the recapitalization to 80 dlrs a share\nfrom 70 dlrs a share.\n    FMC had charged that Boesky received confidential\ninformation about FMC's planned recapitalization from Dennis\nLevine, a former merger specialist with Drexel Burnham Lambert\nInc.\n    An FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that FMC\nmight appeal the ruling, made in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of Illinois, once a formal written\ndecision is received. The written ruling is expected April 15.\n    The spokeswoman said FMC might appeal alleged contract\nviolations involved in the dispute. That part of the case,\ninvolving a contract between FMC and Goldman Sachs and Co,\nwould be appealed to an Illinois state court, she said.\n    Goldman Sachs was FMC's investment banker in its planned\nrestructuring. A FMC spokeswoman said the contract was a\nstandard contract under which Goldman Sachs advised FMC on the\nrestructuring.\n    \"We are certainly taking a look at appealing\" the ruling in\nIllinois state court, the FMC spokeswoman said in response to\nan inquiry.\n    The suit claimed that Boesky bought 95,300 FMC shares\nbetween February 18 and February 21, 1986, selling those shares\nfor a profit of 975,000 dlrs on February 21, the day FMC first\nsaid it was considering a recapitalization.\n    Also, the suit said Boesky bought a further 1,922,000 FMC\nshares between March 12 and April four, acknowledging the\npurchase of a 7.5 pct stake in the company in a 13-D filing\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on April seven.\n    \"We alleged his actions kept the stock price artificially\nhigh and put pressure on FMC to increase the terms of the\nrecapitalization,\" the FMC spokeswoman said.\n    The increase to 80 dlrs from 70 dlrs a share was announced\nApril 26.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

In addition,\nHomestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which\nhave not been drawn on and could be used to finance an\nacquisition, he said.\n    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be\nabout the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.\n    Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly\nhigher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and\ngas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's\n9.6 pct.\n    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about\nthe same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.\n    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin\nreserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400\nounces due to start-up production problems.\n    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400\nU.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Donald Fullerton told reporters\nafter a business speech here.\n    Fullerton said the loans would be listed as non-accrual in\nfinancial results for the second quarter ending April 30.\n    (Bank of Montreal), which has loaned about two billion\nCanadian dlrs to Brazil, the largest amount of any Canadian\nbank, previously said it is also considering declaring the\nloans as non-accrual in second quarter results.\n    Under Canadian guidlines, loans are classified as\nnon-accrual when there are indications the bank will lose\ninterest or principal on the loan or when it believes it will\nbe difficult to fully settle the account within a reasonable\nperiod.\n    Several U.S. banks have already announced they plan to\nplace their loans to Brazil on non-accrual lists.\n    Fullerton also said Canadian Imperial still plans to enter\nthe brokerage business this year after the federal government\nintroduces laws that will let banks expand their actitivities.\n    \"We'll be looking at anything in the Canadian market at\nthis point in time--from the very biggest (brokerage company)\nto the very smallest,\" Fullerton told reporters.\n    Fullerton said he considers buying seats on stock exchanges\n\"a sensible move\".\n    Fullerton declined to comment on TransCanada Pipelines Ltd\n(TRP)'s bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd (DMP). Canadian Imperial has\nabout 900 mln Canadian dlrs in outstanding loans to Dome,\nmaking it one of the oil company's two largest Canadian\ncreditors. The bank has a joint director on Dome's management\nboard, Fullerton said.          \n    Fullerton said he did not have enough information on the\nbid to evaluate its effect on Dome or its debt restructuring\ntalks.\n    Fullerton called in a prepared speech for full reciprocity\nin any free-trade agreement with the U.S. involving financial\nservices.\n    \"There are strong indications that financial services are\nbeing bargained away in the current free trade negotiations\nbetween Canada and the United States with no requirement of\nfull reciprocity,\" Fullerton said.          \n    He said U.S. banks given equal privileges with Canadian\nbanks here would be able to operate throughout the country\nwhile Canadian banks in the U.S. would be subject to approval\nand regulation by each state.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Clevite said\nit would pursue all possible means to collect the amount owed.\n    On April Eight, Clevite said it received a 13.50 dlr a\nshare offer, valued at about 96 mln dlrs, for all of its\noutstanding shares from J.P.

The Commerce Department had already\nruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to\n1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision\nlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.\n    The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on\nimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since\nCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.\n    Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --\nCutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.\n    Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.\nsupply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,\nthe United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of\nBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.\n    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon\ntariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.\n    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final\nreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.\n    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and\ntransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries\ndating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing\nduties, Vastagh said.\n    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,\nincluding three major shippers, would be affected by the\ndecision.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Texaco Inc has re-established some key\noil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for\nprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said\nElton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.\n    \"Several companies say they are willing to start trading,\"\nYates told Reuters in an interview.\n    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic\nand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil\nshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.\nBanks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.\n    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told\nTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco\nsaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.\nMorgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\nto cover transactions, it said.\n    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\nfrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over\nthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\n    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\nplea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\n    \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\ncould,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\nruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\nsupplies.\n    \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\navalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we\ncould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\"\n    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\njeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\nby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\nsaid.\n    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\ncanceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\nOccidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\nAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.\n    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last\nweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today\nsaid, \"a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on\nsupplying. They had cancelled last week.\"\n    He declined to identify the company.\n    <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil\ncompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also\nhalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.\n    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the\nVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key\nsupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the\nAlgerians, he added.\n    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter\n11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines\nand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.\n    \"It will be business as usual for Texaco,\" said Martin\nKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer\nand Traub.\n    \"Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,\" he said. \"But\nwhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and\nwill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.\"\n    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately\navailable to say whether discussions were being held with its\nbanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It rose as high\nas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome\nhas normally moved by only a few cents per day.\n    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\nCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\nDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\ntalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\n    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\nto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\nstressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial\ndifficulties of Dome Petroleum.\"\n    \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\n<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian\ninterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert\nof Peters and Co Ltd.\n    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\nPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\nBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\nof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.\n    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\nin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks\nwith Dome.\n    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\nConoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\n    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully\noptimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\nshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\ndlrs Canadian per common share.\n    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\nshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\nwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\nwould own 80 pct.\n    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\npotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The\nTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"\nhe said.\n    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the\nupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\"\n    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\nbillion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\none billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\nsecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\ncertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\n    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\nCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\nseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the company\nwanted to expand.\n    \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\nof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\nbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"\nGobert said.\n    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\nis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\nreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\ncubic feet of natural gas.\n    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\nof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\nheart of Canada's oil industry.\n   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\nland across Canada.\n   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\nCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of\n2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the\nlargest ever by a Canadian company.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Bernstein and Co, who attended the meeting.\n    Texaco yesterday filed Chapter 11 bankrupcty to protect\nitself from the 10.3 billion dlr judgement awarded to Pennzoil\nfor Texaco's illegal takeover of Getty Oil Co.\n    Texaco spokesmen said they could not comment on the\nanalysts meeting.\n    The company's bankruptcy filing freed Texaco from posting a\nbond for the judgment pending appeal of the case in Texas\nCourts. Pennzoil said it would oppose the Chapter 11 filing.\n    \"They are ready and willing to talk settlement,\" said one\nanalyst who attended the Texaco meeting but declined to be\nnamed. \"But a settlement would be for less now,\" he added.\n    The analysts, a number of whom said they were recommending\nTexaco, said the stock was so cheap that it might open up the\ncompany up to a takeover bid. Texaco declined 3-1/8 to close at\n28-1/2 today.\n    Pzena said company officials were asked at the meeting if\nit would agree to a takeover, but offered \"no comment\" in\nreply. He said the company said that takeover talks were not\nbeing held.\n    \"It would make a lot of sense for Royal Dutch/Shell <RD> or\nExxon Corp <XON> to go out and do it,\" Pzena said. \"But they\nwouldn't make a hostile offer.\"\n    \"This thing has opened them up to a possible acquisition,\"\nsaid Alan Edgar of Prudential Bache Capital Funding in Dallas.\n\"There's a lot of volume (in their stock) and that tells me\nsomeone's messing around,\" he added.\n    Texaco was the most actively traded issue on the New York\nStock Exchange with just under 13 mln shares changing hands.\n    \"I wouldn't rule anything out right now,\" said John Olson,\nan analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    Pennzoil's stock, also on the NYSE's most active list, fell\n15-1/4 points to close at 77.

On Feb 24, it said\nit was told the company had decided against a buyout.\n    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a\nshare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.\n    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner\nmanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and it\nwas conditioned upon payment of the fees.\n    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also\nget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in\nthe tender offer.\n    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner\nas a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their\npositions.\n    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is\nconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of\nsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.\n    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130\nmln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.\n    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt\nof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.\n    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to\nborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln\ndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of\nnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch\nand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to\nMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of\nsubordinated discount debentures.\n    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Pennzoil Co, frustrated by Texaco Inc's\n<TX> decision to seek bankruptcy protection from its 10.3\nbillion dlr court judgment, is preparing to launch a new\nassault that may include investigating assets Texaco\ntransferred from its corporate parent to subsidiaries, legal\nexperts said.\n    Joe Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the company\nwould file a challenge to Texaco's bankruptcy petition sometime\nthis week accusing the oil giant of bad faith and ignoring its\nfiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.\n    The action is almost certain to ignite a new round of\ndebate between the two companies stemming from Texaco's 1984\nacquisition of Getty Oil Co for 10.2 billion dlrs, a company\nPennzoil believed it had an agreement to buy.\n    \"We're going to be doing a lot of things they may not\nlike,\" Jamail said, referring to the bankruptcy court\nproceeding in New York.\n    Some legal experts suggested that a mud-slinging battle in\nbankruptcy court between the two companies might also provoke\nCongressional interest in whether the bankruptcy code is too\nlenient because it permits a profitable firm to freeze debts.\n    Texaco, which has assets totaling 34.9 billion dlrs, sought\nprotection Sunday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy\ncode rather than risk having a Texas appeals court order the\ncompany to post a security bond for the entire amount of the\nPennzoil judgment.\n    Gerald Treece, dean of the South Texas College of Law and\nan observer of the litigation during the past three years, said\nPennzoil was unlikely to prove Texaco is not qualified to be in\nbankruptcy court simply because the giant oil company has a\npositive cash flow and assets that far exceed its liabilities.\n    But Pennzoil may be successful in raising the issue of\nwhether Texaco improperly transferred certain assets from the\ncorporate parent into subsidiaries unaffected by the bankruptcy\nfiling, Treece said.\n    \"Pennzoil's lawyers are going to be like dogs barking at\nthe heels of Texaco wherever they go,\" Treece said, \"I think\npeople are going to be surprised at the level of intensity that\nPennzoil will use in searching for hidden Texaco assets.\"\n    Jamail said Pennzoil objected to Texaco's transfer of an\noil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas from its\ncorporate parent to a subsidiary on Dec. 9, 1985, one day\nbefore a state court judge entered the record jury award\nagainst Texaco. Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemical\nplant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberately\nplaced out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.\n    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weiner\nand Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to place\nadditional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.\n    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, the\ncorporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were included\nin the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only about\nfour pct of Texaco's total revenues.\n    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who represented\nContinental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that set\naside labor union agreements, said the track record of the\nbitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the two\ncompanies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcy\ncourt.\n    \"The courts have been very interested in the issue of\ngood-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmark\ncase in developing that issue,\" Sheinfeld said.\n    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by Manville\nCorp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcy\nexpressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcy\nlaws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed to\nprove it was insolvent in order to seek protection from\ncreditors.\n    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the company\nentered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.\n    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had every\nright to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco had\nembarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984\nthat required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.\nBut Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy case\nmay also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.\n    \"What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be two\nentirely different things,\" Treece said. \"This may be a signal\nto Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcy\nlaws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you are\neither bankrupt or you're not.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Hugh Liedtke, on the MacNeil/Lehrer\nNews Hour, said Pennzoil had offered to settle the dispute\nalong the lines suggested by Wall Street analysts - something\nin the range of three to five billion dlrs - but Texaco Inc\npresident James Kinnear said it was the first time he heard the\nthree to five billion dlrs figure.\n    Kinnear, on the television news program, said Pennzoil had\ntalked about four to five billion dlrs previously.\n    Both executives, who were taped in separate interviews,\neach accused the other of irresponsible actions in the ongoing\nlegal battle, which involves Texaco's 1984 takeover of Getty\nOil Co.\n    Yesterday, Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy code, stating it was unable to continue its\nbusiness because of the legal fight.\n    Liedtke said Pennzoil is prepared to litigate the matter as\nlong as it takes to bring the case to a final conclusion.\n    Lietke said he thought it would take about 18 months to two\nyears to conclude the case.\n    Asked if chance of a settlement were out the window,\nLiedtke replied, \"I've never thought that was the case. I\nalways believed this could be settled. But it will never be\nsettled as long as Texaco has the position that it has that\neither you will settle with us on our basis or we will hold our\nbreath till we die.\" \n    But Kinnear said, \"we offered a big reasonable settlement.\"\n    Kinnear also seemed to confirm remarks made at an analysts\nmeeting earlier today where Texaco said it would only settle\nthe matter for far less than what it offered before.\n    \"The offers we made yesterday won't be repeated tomorrow,\"\nKinnear said.\n    Kinnear charged that Pennzoil was \"using extortionary\npressure to deny us the ability to conduct our business.\" He\nsaid that pressure forced the company into its Chapter 11\nfiling. \n    But he added he still hoped the dispute would be settled.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

A percentage limitation on the personal trading\nof a broker group member with other members of the group, and a\npercentage limitation on filling orders between members of the\nsame broker group, will be set.\n    John Sandner, CME board chairman, said in a statement the\noriginal petition would have adversely affected liquidity,\ndiscriminated against every broker and deprived all customers\nof their right to choose a broker who is a dual trader.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Traders in financial centres in Asia\ngenerally welcomed the first U.S. Night session of futures\ntrading which starts in Chicago on April 30.\n    Traders in Japan, Sydney and Hong Kong said they expected\nthe move to bring benefits, but traders and bankers in\nSingapore said it posed a serious threat to the Singapore\nInternational Monetary Exchange (SIMEX).\n    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in\nWashington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board of\nTrade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday.\n    The CBT plans to offer futures on U.S. Treasury notes and\nbonds, and options on those futures, from 1800 to 2100 hrs\nChicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays.\n    The sessions would mark the start of the trading day, which\nwould end at the present close of business the next day.\n    The proposed hours are designed to coincide with the\nbusiest morning trading hours in Japan.\n    But Andrea Corcoran, chief of CFTC's division of trading\nand markets, said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessions\nto attract primarily U.S. Firms looking for additional\novernight protection.\n    Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected to\nhelp expand U.S. Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge daily\nfluctuation ranges in Tokyo.\n    They said Japanese financial institutions were very\ninterested in using overseas futures markets, but were waiting\nfor finance ministry approval to do so. Approval is expected\nbefore the end of the month.\n    The foreign branches of financial institutions can already\ntrade futures, but in practice make little use of them.\n    But, traders said the timing of the launch was poor, as it\nis in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays.\n    The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays little\ninterest in night trading could be expected until after May 5.\n    Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could be\nlimited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo.\n    The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hour\ntrading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity in\nSydney's eurodollar and U.S. Treasury bond contracts, spokesman\nStephen Calder said.\n    The eurodollar contracts are linked to the London\nInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE).\n    Calder said turnover in both contracts had been\ndisappointingly low since they were introduced last October.\n    He said the CBT move would broaden arbitraging\nopportunities for SFE traders.\n    \"With a late evening lead from Chicago, there's also more\nchance that people will deal here in the afternoon,\" he said.\n    But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed.\n    A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operating\nin Singapore told Reuters: \"Expanding global links between\nfutures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London and\nSydney to its list of rivals.\"\n    \"LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract, with a U.S\ntreasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT,\" the\nSingapore-based Japanese trader said.\n    Such a contract is expected later this year, he said.\n    Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydney\ntreasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchange\nestablished a three-way link with Chicago and London. LIFFE has\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link.\n    \"If this link-up materializes, most traders are likely to\nby-pass SIMEX,\" said one trader.\n    Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision,\nthough they added that local investors would have been more\ninterested in financial futures.\n    \"I think it is very good, because the move will help us to\nincrease our market share here,\" said Joseph Tan, manager of\n<Bache Securities (HK) Ltd>.\n    He said that Bache, like many other local units of U.S.\nCommodity houses, had been participating in Chicago's rregular\nhours of trading for a long time and would like to extend its\nbusiness.\n    Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move, but a\nspokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be more\ninterested if stock index or currency futures were available.\n    Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have become\nincreasingly popular since they were introduced to the market\nin May 1986.\n (See ECRA for Spotlight Index)\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "South Korea has decided on major changes\nin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing\nthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a\ntrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim\nMahn-je said.\n    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports\ncould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase\n\u007fnflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which\nmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign\ndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.\n    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the\ncurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight\nbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion\ndlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation\nand rationalising exports.\n    He said Seoul would try to limit its current account\nsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few\nyears, although trade volume would continue to grow.\n    \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP\n(gross national product) from the current five pct level to\nthree pct by 1991,\" he added.\n    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign\ndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end\nof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5\nbillion dlrs at end-1986.\n    \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to\nremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower\nthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said.\n    The policy change was announced two days before the\nscheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nfor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.\n    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral\ntrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from\n4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing\nin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion\ndlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln\ndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose\n36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.\n    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5\nbillion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw\nmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.\n    \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at\n1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are\nconsiderable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said.\n    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.\n\"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean\ncurrency continues to rise in value,\" he said.\n    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the\ndollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot\nchanges in the value of the won.\"\n    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six\npct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "International banks have radically\nchanged their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtor\nnations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows,\nPhilippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.\n    \"Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult in\nterms of new money for some time now,\" he told reporters at a\nnews conference. \"Within the world there are enormous changes\ntaking place in attitudes of different banks.\"\n    He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from the\npost-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.\n    \"They don't have the same kind of money they used to have\n... They find their whole deposit base eroding,\" Fernandez said.\nGroups of major banks had decided that the international arena\nwas not to their liking.\n    \"They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants\n7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills, but if\nthey are not big enough they don't get the frills.\"\n    The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted to\nrenegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27\nwith its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the same\nterms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week.\n    Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 points\nover Eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread that\nMexico won last October, while the Philippines, which had\ninsisted on a deal similar to Mexico's, restructured 10.3\nbillion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.\n    Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, where\nhundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by an\nadvisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtor\ncountries, was becoming increasingly difficult.\n    He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two or\nthree years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.\n    \"But the present tendency has been that more and more of the\nbanks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have either\nsold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put up\nany more money,\" Fernandez said.\n    He said another disturbing development was the so-called\nnational quota approach adopted by groups of banks.\n    \"Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a look\nat what other groups of banks in other countries are willing to\ndo and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct of\nwhat is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct, then the\nBritish banks say as a whole they will pull out,\" he said.\n    \"There are banks that have decided that lending is not a\ngood business any more. They want to deal in securities, they\nwant to go into investment banking, they want to go into the\nturnover business rather than the carry business,\" Fernandez\nsaid. \"We have to thread our way through a constellation of\nbanks, all of whom have different objectives.\"\n    He said in order to survive, the Philippines would have to\ntry and stimulate new types of inflows, \"whether this be direct\ninvestments, whether this be investments by institutions that\nnow have chosen not to lend but to invest, or whether this be\ndebt to equity conversions.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

As a\nresult, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their\nlevel at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.\n    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs\nat end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.\n    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved\nincentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain\nmore foreign exchange from the goods they sell.\n    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose\n35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46\nbillion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and\nimports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.\n    Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports\nfell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to\n770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The money could be spent on\nproducts which would have a more direct impact in boosting\ndomestic growth, it added.\n    \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo\nsaid. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"\n    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector\namount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent\nestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37\nbillion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.\n    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm\non weekends to put their land up for sale for residential\ndevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,\neconomists said.\n    \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the\nexpansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor\nat Kyoto Gakuen University.\n    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform\nto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic\nrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the\nfarm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really\nwant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to\nraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei\nOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'\nAssociations told a recent press conference.\n    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek\nremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade\ndeficits with Japan.\n    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well\nentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.\n    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there\nare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban\nconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on\nfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several\ncity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.\n    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform\nplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,\nthe analysts said.\n    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the\ntraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for\nnational food security, they said.\n    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to\nimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms\naimed at stepping up productivity, they said.\n    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific\npressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The February increase was less than\nJanauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for\nthe later months of 1986.\n    Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in\nJanuary was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. \n    Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's\n1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine\npct lower than a year earlier, it said.\n    Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in\nFebruary, in line with previous months, although there has been\nsome acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.\n    Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer\nprice inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by\nCanada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the\nU.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates\nof 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\nopens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware\nhis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus\nmarkets is likely to be rejected.\n     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to\nTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an\ninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural import\nprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open\nits markets.\n    \"(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but\nthey are not going to give us anything,\" Lyng said.\n    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions\nduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions\nwould be unveiled later this month, they said.\n    \"If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime\nMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,\" when he\nvisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.\n    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by\npartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.\n    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week\nrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses\nsuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying\nTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.\n    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for\nbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would\nlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.\n    He cited the example of a California company which\ntransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to\ncircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than\nthe value of the animal, he said.\n    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion\nCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow\nfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986\nquota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan\nhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.\n    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to\neliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by\nApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually\nbe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because\nliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese\nmandarin orange industry.\n    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because\nimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And\nJapanese officials have said.\n   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy\nsurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,\nbut some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.\n   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,\nincluding rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in\nGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain\nminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Traders in financial centers in Asia\ngenerally welcomed the first U.S. Night session of futures\ntrading which starts in Chicago on April 30.\n    Traders in Japan, Sydney and Hong Kong said they expected\nthe move to bring benefits, but traders and bankers in\nSingapore said it posed a serious threat to the Singapore\nInternational Monetary Exchange (SIMEX).\n    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in\nWashington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board of\nTrade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday.\n    The CBT plans to offer futures on U.S. Treasury notes and\nbonds, and options on those futures, from 1800 to 2100 hrs\nChicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays.\n    The sessions would mark the start of the trading day, which\nwould end at the present close of business the next day.\n    The proposed hours are designed to coincide with the\nbusiest morning trading hours in Japan.\n    But Andrea Corcoran, chief of CFTC's division of trading\nand markets, said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessions\nto attract primarily U.S. Firms looking for additional\novernight protection.\n    Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected to\nhelp expand U.S. Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge daily\nfluctuation ranges in Tokyo.\n    They said Japanese financial institutions were very\ninterested in using overseas futures markets, but were waiting\nfor finance ministry approval to do so. Approval is expected\nbefore the end of the month.\n    The foreign branches of financial institutions can already\ntrade futures, but in practice make little use of them.\n    But, traders said the timing of the launch was poor, as it\nis in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays.\n    The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays little\ninterest in night trading could be expected until after May 5.\n    Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could be\nlimited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo.\n    The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hour\ntrading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity in\nSydney's eurodollar and U.S. Treasury bond contracts, spokesman\nStephen Calder said.\n    The eurodollar contracts are linked to the London\nInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE).\n    Calder said turnover in both contracts had been\ndisappointingly low since they were introduced last October.\n    He said the CBT move would broaden arbitraging\nopportunities for SFE traders.\n    \"With a late evening lead from Chicago, there's also more\nchance that people will deal here in the afternoon,\" he said.\n    But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed.\n    A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operating\nin Singapore told Reuters: \"Expanding global links between\nfutures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London and\nSydney to its list of rivals.\"\n    \"LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract, with a U.S\ntreasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT,\" the\nSingapore-based Japanese trader said.\n    Such a contract is expected later this year, he said.\n    Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydney\ntreasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchange\nestablished a three-way link with Chicago and London. LIFFE has\nsigned a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link.\n    \"If this link-up materializes, most traders are likely to\nby-pass SIMEX,\" said one trader.\n    Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision,\nthough they added that local investors would have been more\ninterested in financial futures.\n    \"I think it is very good, because the move will help us to\nincrease our market share here,\" said Joseph Tan, manager of\n<Bache Securities (HK) Ltd>.\n    He said that Bache, like many other local units of U.S.\nCommodity houses, had been participating in Chicago's rregular\nhours of trading for a long time and would like to extend its\nbusiness.\n    Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move, but a\nspokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be more\ninterested if stock index or currency futures were available.\n    Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have become\nincreasingly popular since they were introduced to the market\nin May 1986.\n (See ECRA for Spotlight Index)\n REUTER\n\u0003",

In\nfact, the constitution forbids land seizures except as part of\na court-sanctioned agrarian reform process.\n    The Canadian missionaries, the Sacred Heart Brothers, had\nbought the land from the state during the government of\ndictator Jean Claude Duvalier and had planted sugar cane on it,\nthe source said.\n    \"...the peasants are starving to death,\" the source told\nReuters, \"and they saw that the Canadians were working a large\nfertile property.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It\nsaid it has licensed newly-formed Collegiate Pacific West to\ndistribute Collegiate Pacific branded merchandise in 14 western\nstates, western Canada and Japan.\n    It said the leasing and licensing agreements should provide\nabout 200,000 dlrs in revenues a year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Chicago-based\nAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco\nCanada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It said Danners family\nmembers owning 171,538 shares have granted options to Indian to\nbuy their shares on similar terms and conditions.\n    The company said the Danner family options provide that if\nthe infusion is completed, the partnership will have the option\nstarting six months later and ending in April 1992 to buy the\nshares at the last bid or last sales price, whichever is lower.\n    Danners said the agreement is subject to a recapitalization\nby its bank group of outstanding loans, satisfactory company\nprospects, favorable opinon from an investment banker and\nclosing by April 30, with possible extensions to no later than\nMay 11.\n    The company lost 529,000 dlrs in the prior year.\n    Danners said it has terminated its use of LIFO inventory\naccounting, resulting in a restatement of its net worth as of\nFebruary 1, 1986, the last day of its prior fiscal year, to\n15.5 mln dlrs from 9,901,000 dlrs.  But losses for the year\njust ended will result in a net worth deficiency at the end of\nthat year of about 4,400,000 dlrs or eight dlrs per share.\n    The company said it incurred unusual fourth quarter losses\ndue to the previously-announced closing and disposition of 17\nof its 35 3D discount department stores, inventory clearances\nand conversion to a new pricing and promotion system.\n    The company said if it should fail to perform under the\ndeal, it could be liable for all expenses incurred by the\npartnership.  If it does perform but the infusion transaction\ncollapses for another reason, it said it could be liable for up\nto 50,000 dlrs in expenses.\n    It said the Danner family members who have agreed to the\noption have the ability to sell some or all of their shares to\nthe partnership around the closing date at two dlrs each.\n    Danners further said it expects to report a loss for the\nyear ended January 31 of over 19 mln dlrs, substantially worse\nthan it had expected.\n    The company said it also incurred losses in the fourth\nquarter on the disposition of nonoperating assets.  It said it\nexpects to report results for the year soon.\n    Danners said problems with its credit relationships,\ntogether with its losses for the year, resulted in its\ntransaction with Indian, which is intended to alleviate its\nproblems.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

I'm concerned about what I see in recent data\nshowing a substantial fall in the money supply.\"\n    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published\nin the New York Times today, were accurate.\n    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to\nsignals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he\nsaid could have \"political consequences.\"\n    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to\nthe effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential\nand congressional elections next year.\n    \"My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep\nsoup, and there is no question about it,\" he said.\n    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax\nrevenues and a widening of the budget deficit.\n    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central\nbank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of\nbolstering the dollar.\n    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve\nBoard Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further\ndeclines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize\nglobal growth prospects.\n    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to\nstimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that\ncould boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist\npressures in the United States.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The Japanese understand that\nfull well,\" Yeutter said.\n    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that's more of a\npaper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any\nadverse impact on U.S. trade.\"\n    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor\nissue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit\nlater this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.\n    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a\nmajor issue, would be productive but \"I don't see any practical\nway to resolve this particular dispute before or during his\nvisit.\"\n reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Argentina's controversial new\nfinancing package should be completed quickly thanks to a wide\nrange of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez,\nundersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.\n    The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign early\nand an \"exit bond\" provision allowing banks to sell as much as\nfive mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosed\nthat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs\nin the form of a bearer bond. \"We expect to complete the\npackage very quickly,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new\nmoney being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearer\nbond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller\nbanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.\n    The bonds, currently dubbed \"alternative participation\ninstruments,\" would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan\n- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin\nof 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.\n    The idea of the \"exit bond\" is that a creditor bank may\nexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,\ntradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.\n    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt\nconverted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for\npurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.\n    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would\ntake up the \"exit bonds\" because no such instrument has been\noffered before.\n    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate could\nshrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350\ncreditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.\n    Details of the \"exit bonds\" are still being finalized,\nGonzalez added.\n    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the\nlending process because it has bitter memories of its last\npackage, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steering\ncommittee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.\n    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the\nlatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was\nannounced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina on\nthe road to meeting its economic goals.\n    \"We believe this is a package that will help Argentine to\ncontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth\nand equilibrium in the external accounts,\" he said.\n    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in the\nfinal stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent \"practical\nsupport.\"\n    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressed\nfor an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouille\nthreatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of the\nInternational Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banks\nstopped blocking a deal.\n    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspending\ninterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who\nhave long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.\n    \"That was a feeling among people on the committee,\" one\nbanker said.\n    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the same\ninterest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling\nof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would\nraise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8\npct on recent rescheduling packages.\n    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,\nwhich promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of\n13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between the\nPhilippines and the banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The\nframe has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford\nsaid.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller\npowertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and\nimproving fuel economy.\n    Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000\ndlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for\nsteel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of\nwelds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The system is now being replaced by a\nY-pattern globe valve system.\n    It said the 500 mln dlr figure is a preliminary estimate.\n    Niagara Mohawk owns 41 pct of Nine Mile Two, a 1,080 megatt\nboiling water reactor near Oswego, N.Y., with Long Island\nLighting Co <LIL> owning 18 pct, Rochester Gas and Electric\nCorp <RGS> 14 pct and Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp\n<CNH> nine pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Senior U.S. bankers are seeking to\ncalm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms of\nArgentina's new financing package, but a source in New York\nclose to the Manila government said finance minister Jaime\nOngpin is in no mood for compromise.\n    Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina an\ninterest rate spread of 13/16 pct, the same as Mexico won, just\nweeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pct\nbecause the Mexican margin could never be repeated.\n    Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of the\ninterest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentine\npackage in its entirety.\n    Argentina, for instance, is offering banks a 3/8 pct\nparticipation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days\n(declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days), which\nboosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.\n    \"You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct,\" one\nbanker said. Another, referring to the Philippine debt\nnegotiators, said \"The only reason they'd have to come back to\nNew York is political, not economic.\"\n    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra\n1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.\n    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger\ngoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally\nbetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a\nrock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.\nTreasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.\n    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to\npress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory\ncommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, to\nnegotiate the spread reduction by telex.\n    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start\npaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the\ncommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than\nMexico and Argentina, the source said.\n    \"The Philippines really means business on this. I don't\nthink there's much room for compromise,\" he said.\n    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.\n    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule\n10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of\n7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt\nwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.\n    Bankers said they were forced to break their word because\npolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.\n    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentina\nwas serious about its threat to suspend interest payments\nunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium\nwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which has\nalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of the\nReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.\n    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, the\nrich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it\nattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.\n    \"When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, they\nmay realize that this is not a Mexican deal,\" one banker said\nof the Argentine agreement.\n    The Argentine pact contains several features that were not\nin the Mexican accord such as \"exit bonds,\" an option to\nprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlending\nprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.\n    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in\nnew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying\n7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged\nto Mexico.\n    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, who\nnote drily that they asked for no new money at all.\n    \"The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina\nand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they're\ngoing to have problems with both the Philippines and\nVenezuela,\" said the source close to the Manila government.\n    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an\nofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pct\non its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged\nthat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread was\ninviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.\n    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.\n    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, the\ngovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract\nattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt\npackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.\n    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines will\nalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough\nmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The tough trade sanctions President\nReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across\nJapan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade\npractices worldwide, U.S. officials said.\n    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings\nInstitution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can\noften result in a shot in our stern.\"\n    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.\n    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered\non 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress\nthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,\nand no new protectionist legislation is needed.\n    In the past year tough trade action had been taken against\nthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer\nand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,\npatents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.\n    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the\ntariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\"\nto other nations on the need for fair trade practices.\n    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,\ntelevision sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor\nan agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at\nless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The\ntariffs were placed on items which were available from other\nsources so there would be little effect on the American\nconsumer, Fitzwater said.\n    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\n- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\npractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\n    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\n    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\ndlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\none-third of America's overall deficit.\n    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\nGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\npresident is ready to fight them all.\n    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret\nthat these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and\nvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\nAmerican competitiveness in world markets.\n    \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\npractices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California\nvacation home at Santa Barbara.\n    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\nabided by the agreement.\n    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\nwhich is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\nalready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\n    The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't\ndone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\npractice.\"\n    The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an\nexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\nunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\noverall of our trade laws.\"\n    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\nin the best interests of the United States, and that\nnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\n    \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he\nsaid, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\ntrade.\"\n    Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\npolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\non Congress.\"\n    He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\nthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\nand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\nnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n    Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\nimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\nit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n    Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\npolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\non Congress.\"\n    He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\nthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\nand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\nnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n    Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\nimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\nit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\npraised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but\nwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market\nliberalisation efforts falter or fail.\n    In a press conference after talks with South Korean\nleaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention\nto regulate exports and boost imports \"a very, very important\nstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take.\"\n    The government adopted the new policies last week in the\nhope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.\n    Baldrige said the policies \"showed an understanding of the\nfact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by\nexports alone.\"\n    \"There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth\nbegins to take more of the load,\" he said.\n    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with\nWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and\nconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion\ndlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.\n    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was \"broad enough\nand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for\nliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if\nthe government is willing to follow through.\"\n    \"We will be watching the implementation of this new policy\ndirection very closely,\" he said. \"Because of the protectionism\ngrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not\nkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing\nliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn\nbackward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see\nprotectionist movement in the U.S.\"\n    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha\nWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific\nproduct categories.\n    These included service industries, which he said were still\ntoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and\ncars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the\ntariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them\nsell for up to three times their American prices.\n    \"We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's\ngoing to be trouble somewhere down the road,\" he said. \"We are\njust pointing this out.\"\n    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a\nrevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for\nmonths, Baldrige declined to comment. \"We don't have any target\nfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies\naround the world, if we are going to be successful as a world\neconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various\neconomies involved,\" he said.\n    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for\ncooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in\nthird countries. The American government would be pleased to\nencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.\n    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase\ntariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said\nWashington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to\nits difficulties with South Korea.\n    \"I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,\"\nhe said. \"It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for\nnothing or just by asking for it.\n    \"But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they\nusually end up with something good happening at the end that\nboth countries live up to.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will\nnot change its decision to admit China as a member despite\nprotests from founder member Taiwan, bank president Masao\nFujioka said.\n    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the\nbank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused a\nTaiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.\n    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been\ninvited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in\nOsaka, \"but the situation remains the same.\"\n    \"The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,\nChina',\" Fujioka said.\n    \"We have tried to maintain our channels of communication\nthrough the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating with\na view to changing our agreement with China,\" he said.\n    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among\nthe bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.\n    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, which\ncomplained at last year's meeting that for several years the\nADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.\n    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was\nmade to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.\n    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan\nwere disbursed.\n    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for\nVietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only one\nwas under administration at the end of 1986.\n    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986\ntotalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount of\neffective loans, the report said.\n    \"The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank\noperations,\" Fujioka said. \"Vietnam continues to be a member. We\nwould like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult.\"\n    \"It's not a question of political instability, the\nenvironment has to be right for banking operations.\"\n    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, and\nlending operations in China scheduled to start this year, the\nADB had now acquired a \"truly Asian\" character.\n    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of\nexperience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would be\nrouted through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.\n    \"It's been a very slow start,\" Fujioka said. \"We identified\nthree projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only\ntwo left.\"\n    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln\ndlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.\n    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.\n    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250\nmln dlrs.\n    \"There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should\nbe modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,\"\nFujioka said. He did not give details.\n    Fujioka said the ADB saw its lending to the private sector\nserving as a catalyst. The bank's new private sector division\nin 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs without\ngovernment guarantees.\n    In addition, the ADB approved four equity investment\nprojects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs. This raised to 15.18 mln the\ncumulative approvals since equity financing commenced in 1983.\n    But Fujioka said the ADB should not compete with private\nbanks. \"We have a narrow path to walk,\" he said.\n    He said he was happy with the decision of the bank's donor\ncountries to increase the ADB's fund for soft loans.\n    The fourth replenishment of the soft-loan window, the Asian\nDevelopment Fund , brought it to 3.6 billion dlrs, from 3.2\nbillion, Fujioka said. In particular the United States has\nmaintained its 16 pct share,\" said the ADB chief.\n    He said there had been disagreements with the U.S., Which\nholds 14.9 pct of the bank's equity, over lending policies. The\nU.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in its\nimpatience to hit lending targets.\n    \"I suspect there is some arm-twisting,\" he said.\n    \"I find some developed countries are more interested in the\nprocurement side instead of the development side.\"\n    Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lending\nand a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending.\n    Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pct\nof total loans in 1987, from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in\n1985. He said sectoral lending was projected to rise to 20 pct\nin 1987, from 12.8 pct in 1986 and 7.5 pct in 1985.\n    He said the bank would try to reduce some of its liquid\nassets by repaying borrowings carrying high interest rates.\n    \"On the other hand we must maintain our presence in major\nfinancial markets,\" he said. \"Why should we not take advantage of\nhistorically low interest rates?\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Asian countries are offering better oil\nexploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to\nlast year's oil price slump, the United Nations said.\n    The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for\nAsia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price\nfall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which\nfound it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region.\n    Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8\nbillion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated\nto have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled\nin Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985.\n    The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co\nLtd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30\npct cut in exploration and production spending last year.\n    To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced\npetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.\n    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct\nto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its\n12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional\nexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.\nTheir aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 40 billion the previous year.\n    Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986\nfrom 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said.\n    Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion,\nChina three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion.\n    However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine\nbillion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased\ntheir balance of payments.\n    South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan\nwere major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan\nrespectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

I\ncannot emphasise that enough,\" Lyng said.\n    In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato\nyesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked\nJapan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import\nquotas on beef and citrus.\n    Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.\nRequest but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response\nin Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been\nintroduced in both the House and Senate.\n    Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for\nexports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm\nproducts since 1964, especially grains.\n    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land\narea, is concerned about maintaining some level of\nself-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.\n    But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not\nnecessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.\n    Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of\nfarm products as it did in 1973.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The World Bank has suggested India\nshould move to a more open economy by gradually removing most\ngovernment controls on industry and adopting a liberal external\ntrade policy with reduced levels of protection.\n    A confidential \"executive summary\" of a draft Bank report on\nthe Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests\nliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports\nof Indian goods by making them more competitive.\n    The summary said, \"These reforms would result in (domestic)\nprices much more in line with world prices than is true today,\nand in a greater degree of import competition and export\nrivalry than the nation has ever seen.\"\n    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in\nIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal\nimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and\nexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports\nwould provide the foreign exchange for imports.\n    \"The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present\nprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenously\navailable products and to recognise the role of actual or\npotential competition from imports as a source of discipline on\nthe prices and costs of public and private sector domestic\nmanufacturers,\" the summary said.\n    An Indian official told Reuters the government was\ndiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some\nchanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give\nfurther details.\n    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's\nfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss\naid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.\n    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew\nat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and\n1986/87, which ended in March.\n    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of\ngdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by\nnational savings, mainly from the private sector.\n    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed\nto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to\n2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.\n    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to\nlower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers\nwhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.\n    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign\nexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the\nsummary said.\n    The Bank's summary said there was little room for\ncomplacency in the balance of payments position.\n    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,\nIndian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.\n    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a\nyear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable\nbalance of payments, the summary said.\n    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.\nIndia \"might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while\nundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that\ninvolve some political costs,\" it said.\n    \"An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an\nexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,\"\nthe summary said.\n    It said such an approach had been successful in countries\nsuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the\ncompetitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce\nimport pressures.\n    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the\nWorld Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost\nexports.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\npraised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies but\nwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's market\nliberalisation efforts falter or fail.\n    In a press conference after talks with South Korean\nleaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intention\nto regulate exports and boost imports \"a very, very important\nstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take.\"\n    The government adopted the new policies last week in the\nhope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.\n    Baldrige said the policies \"showed an understanding of the\nfact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing by\nexports alone.\"\n    \"There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growth\nbegins to take more of the load,\" he said.\n    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus with\nWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars and\nconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billion\ndlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.\n    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was \"broad enough\nand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken for\nliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, if\nthe government is willing to follow through.\"\n    \"We will be watching the implementation of this new policy\ndirection very closely,\" he said. \"Because of the protectionism\ngrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does not\nkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasing\nliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turn\nbackward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd see\nprotectionist movement in the U.S.\"\n    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister Rha\nWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specific\nproduct categories.\n    These included service industries, which he said were still\ntoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers and\ncars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing the\ntariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make them\nsell for up to three times their American prices.\n    \"We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there's\ngoing to be trouble somewhere down the road,\" he said. \"We are\njust pointing this out.\"\n    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without a\nrevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging for\nmonths, Baldrige declined to comment. \"We don't have any target\nfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currencies\naround the world, if we are going to be successful as a world\neconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the various\neconomies involved,\" he said.\n    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal for\ncooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures in\nthird countries. The American government would be pleased to\nencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.\n    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increase\ntariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige said\nWashington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable to\nits difficulties with South Korea.\n    \"I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,\"\nhe said. \"It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything for\nnothing or just by asking for it.\n    \"But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and they\nusually end up with something good happening at the end that\nboth countries live up to.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Security is a major\nelection issue, with extreme right-wingers accusing the\ngovernment of being soft in the face of a \"revolutionary\nonslaught.\"\n    Botha warned neighbouring black-ruled states not to allow\nthe guerrillas to infiltrate South Africa through their\nterritory. He said South Africa would not hesitate to take\naction to thwart the alleged offensive.\n    Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe denied Botha's\ncharges and said they were a pretext for South African attacks\non them. Pretoria has raided alleged ANC bases in the so-called\nFrontline states in the past.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But the problem of farm\nsurpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is\npolitically difficult for any government to reverse the trend\nof growing farm subsidies.\n    \"This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of\nagriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the\nsustained application of all our energy and our imagination to\nfind solutions,\" Howe said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will\nnot change its decision to admit China as a member despite\nprotests from founder member Taiwan, bank president Masao\nFujioka said.\n    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of the\nbank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused a\nTaiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.\n    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had been\ninvited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 in\nOsaka, \"but the situation remains the same.\"\n    \"The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,\nChina',\" Fujioka said.\n    \"We have tried to maintain our channels of communication\nthrough the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating with\na view to changing our agreement with China,\" he said.\n    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding among\nthe bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.\n    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, which\ncomplained at last year's meeting that for several years the\nADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.\n    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs was\nmade to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.\n    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loan\nwere disbursed.\n    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved for\nVietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only one\nwas under administration at the end of 1986.\n    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986\ntotalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount of\neffective loans, the report said.\n    \"The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bank\noperations,\" Fujioka said. \"Vietnam continues to be a member. We\nwould like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult.\"\n    \"It's not a question of political instability, the\nenvironment has to be right for banking operations.\"\n    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, and\nlending operations in China scheduled to start this year, the\nADB had now acquired a \"truly Asian\" character.\n    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years of\nexperience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would be\nrouted through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.\n    \"It's been a very slow start,\" Fujioka said. \"We identified\nthree projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have only\ntwo left.\"\n    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mln\ndlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.\n    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.\n    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250\nmln dlrs.\n    \"There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India should\nbe modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,\"\nFujioka said. He did not give details.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate the\nefforts that have been made.\n    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank of\nJapan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan's\neconomy away from its dependence on exports for growth. The\nJapanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its\nrelease.\n    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\ntold his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction\nset out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve\nit.\n    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had\nbeen done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus\nits economy.\n    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports of\nmanufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,\nand coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.\n    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the\nfuture to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that\nit would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.\n    \"It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set\nout by the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Falconbridge Ltd said it expected\nresults for the rest of 1987 to improve from the earlier\nreported first quarter operating loss of 15.4 mln dlrs.\n    Chief executive William James told reporters after the\nannual meeting that \"I would hope that the loss for the year\ncertainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter.\nIn other words we are going to make money from here on in.\"\n    Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating loss\nof 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mln\ndlrs.\n    James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadian\ndollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarter\noperating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accounts\nreceivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent\ndecreasing as the U.S. dollar falls.\n    He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker\nnickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the\ncompany's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd\nCreek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production\nthrough the rest of the year and higher average prices this\nyear for precious metals, James added, without elaborating.\n    Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further\ndivestments, James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The\ncompany sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay\ndown debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek\nMines Ltd from Canada Development Corp <CDC.TO>.\n    He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion\ndlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek\nbuy.\n    James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp\n<AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>. Dome's\n23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd <DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge.\n    Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Dome\nbidder, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd to\nChicago-based Amoco, James replied, \"It makes no difference to\nme...whoever takes it over is fine by us.\"\n    He told shareholders that Falconbridges' planned capital\nexpenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160\nmln dlrs last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

However, we have not presented a new proposal to the\ncompany since April 16 and Dome has refused to negotiate with\nTransCanada since that date,\" said TransCanada president Gerald\nMaier.\n    TransCanada said its proposal consists of two parts -- 4.5\nbillion dlrs in cash and securities and one billion dlrs of\npayments to creditors based on future profits.\n    Last week, TransCanada valued the first part of its offer\nat 4.3 billion dlrs, but a spokesman today said the company\nincreased the estimated value of that part to 4.5 billion dlrs\nafter the recent gain in Dome's stock.\n    Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pending\nclarification of TransCanada's offer. It last traded at 1.70\ndlrs per share. Two weeks ago, before TransCanada's offer, Dome\ntraded at about 1.10 dlrs per share.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
