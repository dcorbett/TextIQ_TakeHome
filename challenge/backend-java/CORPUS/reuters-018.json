Reagan\nnominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place.\n    Volcker's term expires in August.\n    Reagan, in a brief announcement in the White House briefing\nroom, said he accepted Volcker's decision \"with great reluctance\nand regret.\"\n    Volcker, first appointed to the Fed post by President Jimmy\nCarter in 1979, said \"there is a time to leave and a time to\ncome ... I have no feeling I was being pushed.\"\n    Volcker, appearing with Reagan, Greenspan, and Treasury\nSecretary James Baker in the briefing room, said he will remain\non the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by the\nSenate.\n    In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him,\nGreenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's\ngreatest achievements was reducing inflation.\n    \"It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain\nthat those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring that\nwill be one of my primary goals,\" Greenspan said.\n    Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of\nVolcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line on\ninflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.\n    Immediately following Reagan's announcement, the U.S.\ndollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both\nthe bond and stock markets declined.\n    But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, which\nhas fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its low\npoint.\n   \n    \"There certainly is evidence in that direction,\" Greenspan\nsaid when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.\n    The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise\nbecause the announcement followed a number of published reports\nthat the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker.\n    Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of major\ninflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10\nper cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per\ncent.\n   \n    With Reagan's backing, Volcker pursued a tight money policy\nthat cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced\ninterest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.\n    The tight money policies were also blamed for producing\na deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political\nproblems for Reagan.\n    Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.\n   \n    Greenspan, who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm,\nwas chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers\nfrom September 1974 until January 1977.\n    Greenspan, a Republican, is considered a traditional\nconservative economist and has been an adviser to several\npresidents.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

But the at the same time, home\nremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs\nfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.\n    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments\nsituation will be required to overcome this declining trend in\nhome remittances, he said.\n    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to\n2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of\nthe boost in exports.\n    He said national investment continued to be small because\nof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more\nsavings were required to maintain or possibly step up the\npresent growth rate and to finance the country's seventh\nfive-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Following is the full text of Federal\nReserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President\nReagan declining reappointment to the Fed:\n    Dear Mr. President,\n    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve\nBoard approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate\nnew appointment.\n   \n    In that connection, you will recall that, upon my\nreappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm\ncommitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a\nsecond full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the\ntime, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do\nthink, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now\ncome for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably\nconvenient and consistent with an orderly transition.\nConsequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I\nplan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to\nassume office.\n   \n    I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for\nyour unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your\nconsistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a\nparticularly challenging period for it, for the financial\nsystem, and for the economy has been critical to whatever\nsuccess we have had.\n   \n    Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those\ninvolved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the\nnation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal\nReserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering\neconomic and financial strength and stability and able to bring\nto that effort a combination of sound and independent\nprofessional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan\nconsiderations.\n   \n    May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder\nof your own term in office during which you have done so much\nto restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the\nAmerican people.\n    Faithfully yours,\n    Paul A Volcker\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said he was\nalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.\n    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section\n1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said\ngeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery\nof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Gordon said he will decide \"in the next few days\" whether to\ngrant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by\nSamjens Acquisition Corp.\n    \"I do not know how I come down on this preliminary\ninjunction,\" Gordon said after listening to arguments by\nattorneys for 1-1/2 days.\n    \"It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much\ninformation as I have been. I have to consider what's been\npresented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be\nwinners,\" he said.\n    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover\neffort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally\nobtained confidential information about the company to make its\noffer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if\nSamjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of\nCanada, were to succeed.\n    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for\nBurlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share.\nMorgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid\n72 dlrs per share for Burlington.\n    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not\ngranted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens\nlawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would\n\"kill the offer\"\n    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the\npartnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction\nwere granted. \"There's only one Burlington,\" he said. \"If we\ncannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.\"\n    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in\nBurlington for 95 mln dlrs. \"We don't want that. We're not in\nthis for the money,\" he said.\n    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that\ninformation provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington\nexecutive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o\ntakeover of Burlington.\n    \"Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider\nJim Ammeen,\" Nathan said.\n    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked\nthe court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge\nsaid he would not rule on the request today.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Allegis\nreported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that\npartnership.\n   \n    An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in\nplanning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent\ncorporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan\nand a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston\nPartners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.\n    The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which\nof its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.\n    Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in\nVancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in\nHilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60\npct of the Westin in Edmonton.\n    Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement\nthe hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert\nunrecognized asset appreciation into cash.\n    As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,\nthe money will be used for general corporate needs, the\nspokesman said.\n    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead\nunderwriters for to the public offering.

        "body": "The Bundesbank is unlikely to change\ncredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\nfor its last session before the Venice summit, banking\neconomists and money market dealers said.\n    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\nby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\nunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\nin the near future, they said.\n    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\nbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\n    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\nusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\ndid not necessarily herald any policy moves.\n    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\nthere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\ngrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\nstable against the mark.\n    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\nopened a representative office, that the West German economy\nwas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\n1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\n    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\na 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\nBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\nminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\n    \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\nlower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\nLombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\nMunchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\nGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\naround historical lows for West Germany.\n    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\neconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\nwith companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\n    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\non interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\n\"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.\n    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\nline with the new structure of money market rates since last\nmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\n    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\ndiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\n    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\nclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"\n    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\ncut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\npolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\n    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\ncuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\ndeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\n    \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\nVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"\nsaid Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\n    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\nVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I\ndon't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.\n    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\nnormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\nand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\nmonth-end distortions.\n    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\nmonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\nbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\nTwo public holidays that week could also distort the market.\n    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\ntomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\npct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\nand to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\n    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\nallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not\nrepresent a tightening of policy, however.\n    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\nat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\nallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\nto lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\nUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\non this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\nSaarland bordering France, and was twice under French\noccupation this century.\n    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\nthis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\nto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\ntreated for minimum reserve purposes.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Bonn officials\nhave said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but\ncould still fall below the 1986 level.\n    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany\nagreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in\nFebruary aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.\n    The stance taken by the experts backs up the official\nposition of the West German government ahead of next week's\nseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be\npressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.\n    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not\nin a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due\nnext year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.\n    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official\ninterest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.\n    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of\nbetween 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a\nforecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.\n    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987\npredictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government\nitself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,\ncompared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He said he was\nalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.\n    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section\n1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said\ngeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery\nof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.\n    \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil\nresources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly\nequal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides\nalmost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said.\n    He said production from the new section could begin about\nthe time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000\nwithout endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It has\nrepeatedly said it cannot accommodate any new members until\nthen because of limited space on its trading floor.\n    During a visit to Tokyo in April, U.K. Corporate Affairs\nMinister Michael Howard presented Japanese officials with what\nhe called a non-negotiable timetable for granting the three\nBritish securities companies TSE membership.\n    Howard said Britain expected a favourable response at last\nweekend's meeting and wanted the firms to be made members\nbefore next May. If Tokyo failed to act, Britain was ready to\nretaliate against Japanese financial groups in London, he\nadded.\n    Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans to set\nup a special committee to study the membership question.\n    The committee is due to produce a report by the autumn.\nThis would allow the TSE to announce formally by the end of the\nyear who will be granted membership, although the companies\nchosen would not be able to start trading until May.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Mortgage rates moved to double\ndigits in april for the first time since last summer.\n    The Goldman spokeswoman said that sales of adjustable rate\nmortgages was a significant factor in Hottensen's original\nearnings estimates.\n    Last year, when the company's net income was 3.22 dlrs a\nshare, Ahmanson generated more than half of its 541 mln dlrs of\npretax income from gains on loan sales, the spokeswoman said.\n    She said the reduction in earnings estimates to 2.60 dlrs a\nshare in 1987 from a previous estimate of 3.30 dlrs, reflects\nless optimism with the mortgage loan environment.\n    In the present environment for mortgages, the spokeswoman\nsaid, Ahmanson's second quarter earnings should drop to 45 cts\na share from last year's 80 cts a share.\n    Hottnesen expects the savings and loan to earn between 2.90\ndlrs and 3.10 dlrs a share in 1988. he had previously estimated\nearnings of 3.30 dlrs a share in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The key to a\nstronger dollar lies in the United States itself,\" Leutwiler\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil's\nsuspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mln\ndlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.\n    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experience\nestimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.\nIt said it is committed to building its general provision for\nloan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans to\ntroubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.\n    The bank said non-accrual loans totalled 3.3 billion dlrs\nat April 30--1.5 billion in domestic loans and 1.8 billion in\ninternational loans. Excluding the 1.3 billion dlrs in loans to\nBrazil, net non-accrual loans at the end of the second quarter\ndeclined 200 mln dlrs over the 1987 first quarter, it said.\n\n\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. analysts expect the American\nPetroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show\na slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended\nMay 29, oil traders and analysts said.\n    While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not\nrule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that\nbarring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the\nreport to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.\n    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be\nsteady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil\nprices, the analysts said.\n    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports\ncontinue at relatively high levels.\n    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln\nbarrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.\n    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who\nlooks for a build said, \"We have had five weeks of gasoline\ndemand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to\nbetween 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand\nwould have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,\" he added.\n    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw\nin stocks of about of about one mln barrels.\n   \n    The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest\nreport for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline\ndemand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.\n    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to\nfounder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3\npct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.\n    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add\nto U.S. stocks.\n    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery\nruns.\n    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between\n700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level\nreported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was\ndiscounted as having a market impact at this time.\n    \"A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,\"\none futures analyst said.\n    Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build\nbetween 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels\nreported by API for the week of may 22.\n    The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added\nto the nation's inventory.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It is more than was talked\nabout when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.\n    \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe\nthat getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the\neconomy,\" he added.\n    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news\nconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might\ndecide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on\nsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:\n    \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an\nagreement that had been reached between the United States and\nJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip\nmarket.\n    \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the\nagreement that it made become evident.\"\n    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the\nsituation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a\ntrend on only one month's data.\n    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal\ncomputers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that\nJapan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by\nselling computer chips at below fair market value.\n    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do\nwell to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.\n    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to\ntake action to stimulate the world economy without a bold\nAmerican initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget\ndeficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the\nproblem.\n    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit\nwould probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against\nlast year, and that the budget being worked on this year would\ncontain a major reduction.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The ACP estimates\nthis would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its\nmember country exports.\n    \"We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to\nundermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these\nmeasures,\" Wilson said.\n    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit\nby the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it\nis approved.\n    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very\nlast resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other\ncountries which oppose the plan.\n    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear\nJamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not\nexport oils and fats.\n    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,\nSenegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Noranda previously said it is spinning off its vast\nforest product holdings into the new company and is now making\nan initial public offering of Noranda Forest shares.\n   \n    Zimmerman told Reuters that he agrees with one forest\nindustry analyst's prediction that Noranda Forest will earn at\nleast 165 mln dlrs in 1987.\n    Noranda Forest's preliminary share prospectus, released\ntoday, shows the company had 1986 pro forma earnings of 80.2\nmln dlrs, excluding a 22.5 mln dlr extraordinary gain.\n    Asked to comment on the analyst's forecast that Noranda\ncould earn about 200 mln dlrs this year, Zimmerman said, \"I\nthink that he is directionally very correct.\"\n    He also said Noranda Forest will consolidate financial\nresults of 50 pct-owned MacMillan Bloedel Ltd <MB.TO>.\n    Zimmerman said Noranda Forest expects to raise at least 350\nmln dlrs from its first share issue, making it one of Canada's\nlargest initial public offerings.\n    Noranda Forest intends to issue about 15 pct of its common\nshares to the public at first, but parent company Noranda Inc\n\"is prepared to let up to 49 pct of it go into the public hands,\"\nhe added. Noranda Inc now holds all of the 79.9 mln outstanding\nshares of Noranda Forest.\n    Zimmerman declined to say when future secondary share\nofferings might occur, although he said they will be made \"as\nsoon as it's right\" for either cash or other securities.\n    Proceeds from the share issue will be used mainly to reduce\nNoranda Forest's long term debt, listed pro forma as 1.36\nbillion dlrs at the end of first quarter, 1987, chairman\nZimmerman said.\n    Noranda Forest's first priority will be to continue cutting\ndebt to \"a comfortable, manageable level in all likely future\ncircumstances\" or about 30 pct of capital, he said.\n    \"I think we learned last time around that although your\nassets can support a high levels of debt, earnings can't\nsupport associated interest in times of high interest rates,\"\nZimmerman commented.\n    Noranda Forest had pro forma operating losses of 8.6 mln\ndlrs in 1985 and 2.9 mln dlrs in 1984 during periods of higher\ninterest rates.\n    The company's pro forma 1987 first quarter results showed\nnet profit of 42.2 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share, up from earnings\nof 4.7 mln dlrs or one ct a share, excluding a 22.5 mln dlr\nextraordinary gain, in the prior year.\n    Zimmerman also said the company will concentrate on\nmaintaining quality earnings from existing operations rather\nthan increasing operating volumes. \"We are likely to spend money\nto enhance our operations ahead of expanding them,\" he said.\n    Noranda Forest would also be interested in buying the 50\npct interest it does not already own in Northwood Pulp and\nTimber Ltd from Mead Corp <MEA> for between 150 mln and 200 mln\ndlrs, Zimmerman said.\n    Noranda Forest and Mead each have the right of first\nrefusal the other's Northwood holding, but Mead likely is not\nanxious to sell, he added.\n    Noranda Forest's initial dividend policy will be to pay 10\ncents a share quarterly. When asked, Zimmerman agreed the\ndividend was small compared to cash flow, adding the company\nwill later \"establish a typical or sensible dividend policy.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.K. Bankers for the most part lauded\noutgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his\nachievements over the past eight years but expressed some\nuncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated by\nPresident Reagan to succeed him.\n    \"One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense of\ncontinuity and stability he gave to the international markets,\"\nsaid Carlos Santistevan, executive director of Libra Bank Plc.\nHowever, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to\nfill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said.\n    Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm,\nTownesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the\nCouncil of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.\n    \"He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S.\" said\nDavid Lomax, Group Economics Adviser at National Westminster\nBank Plc, who described Greenspan as an \"orthodox Republican\neconomist\" who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economy\non track than Volcker.\n    But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar with\nGreenspan's views on domestic and international economics or\nthe international debt crisis.\n    \"I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker of\ngood repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And\ninternational banking system,\" said Libra's Santistevan.\n    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted\ncountries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as\nfamiliar with the problem and the personalities involved.\n    For this reason he expects there will be little change in\nthe Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial\nbanks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding\nbillions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on\nthird world debt.\n    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American\ndebt problem also doubted there would be much change\npost-Volcker, but for other reasons.\n    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's\ndebt initiative which called for greater contributions by\nbanks, governments and multilateral organization, government's\nhave done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the\nbulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.\n    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he\nquestioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the\njob so close to the next Presidential election.\n    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the\nfinancial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on\nforeign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank\nintervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover\nsomewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one\npoint, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost\nmore than one point.\n    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank\nPlc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the\nannouncement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the\ndollar against the mark and yen.\n    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar\nhas fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today\nannouncing his nomination Greenspan said \"there certainly is\nevidence\" that the dollar had bottomed out.\n    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise\nin the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to\nfall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to\nreverse.\n    \"The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few\nyears\" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important\nthing is that there is a soft landing.\n    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear\nGreenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.\n    \"He has everything going for him but he must establish\ncredibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the\noutlook for interest rates,\" he said.\n    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a\nstance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his\ntightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to\nrecord levels.\n    \"He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only\nrelaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted\n(in 1982),\" National Westminster's Lomax said.\n    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit the\nagreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the\nGroup of Five industrial nations on the dollar.\n    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stability\nbeing maintained because of a monetary policy that is too\ntight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Into\nrecession, which would not be welcome by European counterparts,\nhe said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10\nsuch newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23\ndailies.\n    \"There is really no end to the ones that are available,\" he\ntold reporters, although he added that most remaining\nacquisition opportunities are in the U.S.\n    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,\nof London, should become profitable in this year's fourth\nquarter.\n   \n    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or\nbetter, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and\nimproved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest\ncirculation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian\ndlrs last year.\n    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told\nreporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily\ncirculation had risen by 25,000 since September to about\n1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new\nIndependent daily newspaper.\n   \n    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the\nTelegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation\nof other London quality dailies such as The Times and The\nGuardian.\n    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post\n1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,\nincluding extraordinary gains from previous sales of\ndiscontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54\ndlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an\nextraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.\n   \n    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating\nearnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs\nagainst a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.\n    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs\nfrom 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily\nTelegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter\nfigures were not disclosed.\n    He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss\nwas sharply reduced from last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The European Community was set to\nplunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministers\nfailed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in the\nnear-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said.\n    As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks in\nLuxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accord\namongst the trading bloc's 12 member states.\n    The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a\ndeficit this year of at least five billion European Currency\nUnits and could be forced to choose between massive spending\ncuts or bankruptcy.\n    It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5\nbillion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farm\nspending and falling revenues.\n    But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that\nthere can be no extra cash for the Community this year and\ninstead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbs\ntwo thirds of the EC budget.\n    \"We have to make clear that expenses should be based on\nincome,\" West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer told\nreporters.\n    \"There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financing\nin the form of national contributions,\" he added.\n    A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of the\nbudget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in\nadvance for their spending on Community farm policies, was also\nfar from agreement, diplomats added.\n    The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany,\nwould save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for\ntwo months.\n    But poorer member states, which would have to borrow funds\nto cover the delay, complain the change in the system would\nunfairly impose too much of the burden on them.\n    The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early\ndebate on the changeover in the farm payments system, further\ndelaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentary\nsources said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "West Germany's biggest\nbank said it would withhold support from Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>\nmanagement at next month's annual meeting because of the VW\ncurrency scandal.\n    Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> said it would abstain in votes\nexonerating VW management and the supervisory board, which\nrepresents shareholders and employees, unless an auditor's\nreport on the currency scandal is published before the July 2\nannual meeting and either clearly absolves or blames the\nmanagement and board.\n    Several shareholder groups have said they will vote against\nmanagement at what promises to be a stormy annual meeting. If a\nmajority of shareholders back these groups, the top management\nof Europe's biggest carmaker could be dismissed.\n    Deutsche said it expected the results of the auditor's\nreport on the currency fraud, which cost VW some 260 mln dlrs,\nto be published before the annual meeting.\n    But in a letter to Deutsche customers depositing their VW\nshares at the bank, Deutsche wrote: \"Without knowledge of these\nresults, we do not think we are in a position to make you a\nsuggestion for or against exoneration of the management board\nand supervisory board.\"\n    \"Unless you give us instructions to the contrary, we will\nabstain with your shares ... but we reserve the right to vote\nfor or against exoneration of the management board and\nsupervisory board, if this seems in your interest in line with\nthe results of the auditor's report,\" it added.\n    A strong shareholder vote against the management would\nempower the supervisory board to dismiss the management if it\nchooses, though such a move would not be mandatory.\n    A member of the supervisory board who does not receive\nexoneration at an annual meeting may have to step down.\n    An abstention or no-vote by banks on behalf of customers\nagainst management would in itself be a vote of no confidence.\n    German banks traditionally use their huge proxy votes at\nannual meetings to support the management of the company, in\nwhich they are often represented on the supervisory board.\n    VW management board chairman Carl Hahn said in April that\n1986 profits had been hit by the scandal, in which documents\nrelating to currency arbitrage were allegedly faked, but\nprofits for 1987 would not be affected.\n    Following the scandal, finance director Rolf Selowsky\nresigned, and former chief dealer Bobby Junger was arrested.\n    Deutsche represents 8-10 pct of VW's share capital, the\nsources said, and F. Wilhelm Christians, one of the bank's two\nmanagement board spokesmen (chief executives) is on the VW\nsupervisory board.\n    Banking sources said Deutsche was furious with VW after the\nbank led an international placement of VW shares from the\ncompany's record rights issue last September.\n    Less than two months later VW announced a sharp fall in\ninterim profits, bashing its share price and severely denting\nconfidence in the German share market generally.\n    A spokesman for the Savings Bank Association said that\nGerman savings banks would vote not to discharge Selowsky, and\ndepending on whether the auditor's report was published would\nabstain on the vote for other management board members.\n    The federal government and the state of Lower Saxony\ntogether have 40 pct of VW shareholders' votes. It is still\nunclear how they will vote. Associations representing small\nshareholders will also ensure the annual meeting is heated.\n    The Protective Association for Securities Ownership has\nsaid it will vote against the entire management board, and the\nProtective Society for Small Shareholders will also vote\nagainst the supervisory board.\n    A spokeswoman for Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG, the\nauditors commissioned by VW in March to investigate the\nscandal, declined to comment when its report would be issued.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good\nfundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices\nfor the metal.\n    In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham\nsaid continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices\nup eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last\nmonth.\n    \"Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates\nof our trucks,\" he said, referring to tightness of supply and\nstrong demand. \"The fundamentals are good.\"\n   \n    Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;\n\"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored.\"\n    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for\nalmost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on\nrecord behind 1984, he said.\n    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with\nannual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.\n   \n    During the interview, executive vice president Douglas\nYearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before\nthe copper price rose \"because there aren't that many new\nprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,\nwill continue to grow modestly.\"\n    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to\nmore than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound\nrise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for\nPhelps Dodge, the company said.\n    \"Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction\nand other areas,\" Yearley said.\n   \n    New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine\nowned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's\n<BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's\nown expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production\nshortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.\n    Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located\nChino mine will be in line with conventional copper production\nat the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The\ncompany's total production costs, including depreciation but\nbefore interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a\npound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Hutton\nanalyst Bernard Sosnick.\n    The company's stock closed at 50, off 1-1/4.\n    Sosnick said \"sluggish sales cloud the economic picture and\nconcern about the outlook for credit income diminish Sears'\nnear-term investment prospects.\" He said the retail sales in\nMay were weak, which would mean sales have been below plan for\nthe past two months.\n    Sosnick said indications are that Sears may not be as\nstrong a performer as other retailers.\n    However, he said his earnings estimate for the company for\n1987 remains unchanged at 4.50 dlrs a share compared to 3.62\ndlrs a share in 1986. He added that \"as a result of weakening\nsales momentum, we have less confidence in that estimate.\"\n    The analyst said it projects second quarter earnings in the\n1.05 to 1.10 dlrs a share range, up from 77 cts a year ago. The\n1987 estimate includes an 18 ct a share gain from the sale of\n50 savings bank branches and strong earnings contribution from\nAllstate Insurance.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Paul Volcker's departure as Federal\nReserve Board chairman came despite pleas from the Reagan\nadministration that he stay at the helm of the U.S. central\nbank, U.S. officials said.\n    \"The President made it very clear that he would be very,\nvery pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise,\"\nTreasury Secretary James Baker said.\n    A Reagan administration official, who asked not to be\nidentified, said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in the\npast several months to consider staying on as chairman.\n    But there were no indications the administration had told\nVolcker that it was in the national interest for him to stay\nand that current global economic uncertainties required it.\n    Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only have\nstayed on in such circumstances. \"He doesn't care a lot,\nemotionally, about a third term,\" Nikko Securities vice-chairman\nStephen Alixrod, until last year a top Fed staffer, told\nReuters recently.\n    Officials are confident that newly-nominated chairman Alan\nGreenspan will re-establish close working relations with Baker\nand his credentials eventually will calm markets.\n    One Reagan administration economic policymaker, who asked\nnot to be named, pointed out that Baker and Greenspan worked\ntogether closely in the Ford administration.\n    At the time, Baker was acting Secretary of Commerce and\nGreenspan headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\n    Reagan administration officials made clear, meanwhile, that\nthe announcement, precipitated by Volcker's unshakeable\ndecision to quit, came in order to clear up uncertainty ahead\nof the Summit of leading industrial democracies in Venice.\n    President Reagan might have been in an embarrassing\nposition if no decision had been made by then.\n    Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officials\nabroad, and is admired at the West German Bundesbank, and in\nTokyo, despite his criticism  of Japanese policies.\n    Financial markets, possibly reflecting some of the\ndisappointment in foreign capitals, drove the dollar sharply\nlower on news of his departure, prompting central bank\nintervention to stem the fall, dealers said.\n    Finance Ministries and central banks of the other summit\nnations -- Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and\nCanada -- were informed shortly before the news was announced,\nBaker told reporters today.\n    Monetary sources also said one reason Volcker decided to\nresign was his personal financial situation and his marriage \n-- his wife lives in New York and did not want him to take up a\nsecond term in mid-1983.\n    Volcker has foregone potentially million-dollar salaries to\na life almost overwhelmingly devoted to public service at pay\nrates low relative to his financial commitments.\n    Both these reasons at one time prompted him to consider\nstepping down before his second term was completed.\n    But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personal\nreasons for his decision. \"It was a personal decision, taking\naccount of a lot of things, including purely personal\nconsiderations and others,\" he told reporters.\n    Fed sources note Volcker's considerable unease at the lack\nof progress by the administration in reaching a budget deficit\nreduction agreement.\n    In addition, Volcker would have faced four more years with\na Board that he was less than comfortable with, monetary\nsources say. The other five members are Reagan appointees.\n    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that the\nFed governors now have only six to seven years' collective\nexperience between them, at a time of great financial\nuncertainty.\n    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered\nas tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republican\ncredentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman\nthan Volcker.\n    An administration official said Volcker was consulted on\nGreenspan \"and very much approved of his replacement.\"\n    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the\nadministration, to whom he has been an unofficial economic\nadviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had\nwith the Nixon administration.\n    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration\nviewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to\nmake radical policy changes.\n    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker told\nreporters, \"I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness\nyesterday.\" Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the\nWhite House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.\n    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he would\nprobably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the\ndeparture of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor\nthat convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost\nfrom the start of the administration.\n    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being able\nto work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the\ninternational debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying\ndollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Sam Gibbons, said the\nagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against\ncongressional approval of protectionist textile quota\nlegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other\nAsian textile producing countries.\n    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill\nbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is\nexpected to be voted on in the House this year.\n    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of\na major trade bill without specific protections for textiles\nshowed a weakening of support for the legislation.\n    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign\nproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel production\nequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic\nmarkets, Kelly said.\n    He added that private investment in the textile and\nclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh\nthe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.\n    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of\ntextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct\nwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.\n    \"The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by\nnew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the\nindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets\nthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research\nindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,\nand that exports can be expanded,\" Kelly said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert\nDurham said the company is prepared to make another large\nnon-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the\nnear future.\n    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was\nexamining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.\n    He declined to name the companies but said a deal could\noccur as soon as the second half of 1987.\n   \n    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in\nthe U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals\nCo, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires\namong other products.\n    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and\neventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper\noperations.\n    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs\nto buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about\n100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.\n   \n    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different\neconomic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good\nmanagement, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly\ndeal, he added.\n    \"We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or\nabout a perfume company,\" he said. \"We want a good basic\nindustrial company that will fit into our management\nstructure,\" Durham said.\n   \n    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said\ncontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to\nhigher prices for the metal.\n    \"In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price\n(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new\nprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,\nwill continue to grow modestly,\" said executive vice president\nDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of\nproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50\ncents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and\ncorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.\n    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now\ncompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts\nsaid.\n    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been\nfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.\n    He declined to project results for the second quarter or\nyear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in\ncopper prices in the last month will help results.\n    Durham said last month that the second quarter should match\nthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln\ndlrs or 49 cts a share.\n    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,\nreflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased\ncopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also\nacquired last year.\n    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75\ndlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The U.S. House of Representatives \napproved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to\nprovide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not\nplace any restrictions on its actions.\n    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds\nof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance\nof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to\ndefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators\noppose President Reagan's policies in the region.\n    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th\nIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,\nwhich killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11\nKuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --\neffectively making them American ships.\n    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and\nRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --\nrequired Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a\nreport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to\nprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.\n    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the\nadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and\nthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.\n    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this\nweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.\n    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a\nfirst step toward a greater congressional involvement in\nformulating policy.\n    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the\nadministration to address tough policy questions in the report.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Colombian tax authorities are investigating\nOccidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.\n    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up\nto 800 mln dlrs.

        "body": "The U.S. meat industry has launched an\naggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer\nawareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to\nrelax current beef import quotas.\n    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs\nannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high\nas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were\nremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the\nattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export\nFederation said at a press conference today.\n    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the\nAgriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)\nprogram, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was\nlaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.\n    \"The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the\nbright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,\" said Philip Seng,\nAsian Director for the Federation. \"We supply and they (Japan)\nbuy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to\nbuy more,\" he said.\n    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits\ntotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.\nimports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding\nU.S. beef shipments to Japan.\n    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy\nJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement\nexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get\nunderway this fall.\n    The Reagan administration has called for an end to the\nquotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they\nwould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.\n    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that\nthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that\nthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.\n    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market\nhas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry\nofficials said.\n    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.\ntenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs\nfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association\nsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs\nper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.\n    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef\nper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,\nofficials said.\n    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000\ntonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a\ndecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Paul Volcker's resignation as Federal\nReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a\ntime of deep uncertainty about the future management of the\nthird-world debt crisis, bankers said.\n    They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold\nthe financial system together when Mexico halted interest\npayments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever\nsince.\n    \"Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly\nthere's a terrible void,\" one New York banker said.\n    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed\nbecause International Monetary Fund managing director Michel\nCamdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it\nhard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.\n    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little\nexperience of international affairs and third world debt.\n    \"Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues\nand the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker\nhas. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.\nThat was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive\nfeeling,\" one banker said.\n    This banker, who has discussed debt questions with\nGreenspan, described his views as simplistic.\n    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was not\nworried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.\n    \"People rush to judgment, but once they get to know\nGreenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,\"\nsaid Hormats, a former Administration official.\n    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the\ninitial comparison, Hormats said. \"Volcker had the status of a\nfinancial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,\"\nhe said.\n    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together with\nthe Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the banking\nsystem intact after Mexico's default.\n    \"If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot\ndifferent now,\" he said. \"Whether you agreed with him or not,\nhe has a superb grasp of ideas.\"\n    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with\nVolcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for\nmore or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico\ngenerous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt\nrescheduling agreement.\n    \"Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the\nbounds and pushing the package onto the banks,\" commented one\nbanker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.\n    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said\nthe 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and\nthus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.\n    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of\nothers that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines\nand Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt\ncrisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to\nbolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.\n    \"It certainly contributed to the general feeling of\nmalaise,\" one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of\nthe Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion\ndlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.\n    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and\nSecurity Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of\ncreditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.\n    But no one is sure what the impact will be. \"It's very\ndifficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is\ngoing, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the\nuncertainty,\" one banker said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Currency futures are likely to move\nhigher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan\nannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as\nFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated\nas his replacement, currency analysts said.\n    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,\nanalysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between\nnow and the June 8 Venice economic summit.\n    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to\nthe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,\nanalysts said.\n    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing\na bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in\nChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a\ntechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,\nanalysts said.\n   \n    \"Disappointment of European central bankers over the\nappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar\nlower,\" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol\nMackoff.\n    \"The international community will not like this\nappointment,\" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.\nbudget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and\nthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to\nreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David\nHorner.\n     Furthermore, \"that Greenspan was not named two months ago\nsuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --\nand that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,\"\nHorner said.\n    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures\nprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated\nonly by concrete action as opposed to \"jawboning\" at the G-7\nsummit, he said.\n    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may\nbe at an impasse, analysts said.\n    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither\nplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the\nU.S. to do so, Mackoff said.\n    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit\nas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.\n    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its\nbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the\ndollar could be forestalled, Horner said.\n    However, \"the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing\nchanges,\" Horner said.\n    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane\nsaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end of\ntheir 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.\n    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen\nfutures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September\nmarks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss\nfrancs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The World Bank has suspended loans to Peru\nbecause the country has over two months of payment arrears with\nthe lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyra\nsaid.\n     He told reporters the government decided to stop paying\nthe World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed the\nloans it was due to receive.\n     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adopted\nby the government of President Alan Garcia, one of Latin\nAmerica's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-old\nadministration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earnings\non nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.\n     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodation\nwith the World Bank under which it would receive more credits\nthan it would remit in repayments.\n     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the world\nbank. The country had recently increased its capital\nsuscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.\n    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements to\nPeru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specify\nthe value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry said\nPeru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.\n    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at\n14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which is\nmedium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Total\narrears were 5.42 billion dollars.\n    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enough\nhard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11\nmonths' worth of imports.\n    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hard\ncurrencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,\nhe said.\n    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrs\nbecause this classification did not include silver holdings and\nundervalued the central bank's gold.\n    Reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs this\nyear, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Plans for key reforms of the European\nCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost\ncertainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government\nat a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance minister\nMark Eyskens said today.\n    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a\njoint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was\ndesigned to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm\nprice package which has endured since March.\n    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques\nDelors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a\ndisaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had\nto be referred to heads of government.\n    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and\nvegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system by\nwhich EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units\n(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.\n    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries\nwhich fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., A\nmajor exporter of soybeans to the EC.\n    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technical\ncurrency move, which would result in additional price cuts for\nfarmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.\n    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two\nissues are not referred to the summit because this would mean\nheads of government diverting their attention from much more\nimportant world and Community issues.\n    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also\nlikely to be less sound since they do not usually interest\nthemselves in such technically complex questions.\n    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some\nnuances in member state positions \"which may make the dialogue\nmore constructive in the next few weeks.\"\n    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,\nthe Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct\ncut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originally\nproposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this\nyear, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.\n    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a\nprice package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for\ntheir disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency\nreforms.\n    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need\nfor budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC\nbudget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.\n    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's\nmeeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of a\nmajor shift in the position of member states, or of finance\nministers adopting a different line from that of their\nagriculture colleagues.\n    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this\nweek in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their\ndifferences.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Last year to revive the\nAfrican economy over five years.\n    The response from the international community has been\nnegative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa\nalready look far too optimistic, ECA Executive Secretary\nAdebayo Adedeji told the conference.\n    Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts of\nAfrica's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment\nand grace terms to be eased.\n    They won a degree of support from Landry, \"Even private\nbankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term\nsolutions to Africa's debt.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Prices are\nlikely to remain at current historically low levels at least in\nthe medium term, and competition with other metals and\nmaterials will continue to intensify,\" Goekmann said.\n    \"In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world's\nmarket and economics. In the future, we have to act less\ndefensively and more aggressively.\"\n    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problem\nhas to be tackled quickly, he added.\n    \"Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity in\nEurope have all failed miserably. However, there is some hope\nthat current efforts may be successful,\" Goekmann said.\n    At the same time, companies must move to limit their\ngeographical and currency risks and become far more marketing\norientated, he added.\n    \"With all these changes and rationalization, the industry\ncan survive to recover its past strength and profitability.\nWithout them, the future does not look very rosy,\" Goekmann\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising\nwaters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the\nreopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inch\nsteel piping was installed under the river to replace damaged\npiping, according to Stevens.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It is\nimpossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should be\nno problems unless something drastic happens,\" one trader said.\n    Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that most\nIvory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the\nweekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday.\n    \"Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quite\ndry, except along the western portion of the coast,\" it said.\n    Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dry\nconditions had not affected the entire country.\n    The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for\ncomment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfall\nin recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,\nalthough it is difficult to assess what the minimum\nrequirements are.\n    Trade sources said there had been good rains in late\nJanuary, February and March which helped to promote flowering,\nbut April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the\nsouth west of the country.\n    The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered by\nMarch/April rains but the main crop, still in its formation\nperiod, depends largely on rainfall from April through July.\n    The main rains normally last between May and July, before\nreturning again in September/October. \"Flowering has been less\nthan normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the\nmoment, then they have a chance to recover,\" one trader said.\n    Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of\ntime to develop and the rains were \"not good but still not bad.\"\n    The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a\ncause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa were\npresently taking a back seat to other factors in the\ninternational cocoa market.\n    This is not only because of the premature nature of any\nharvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa\nalready burdening the market, they said.\n    \"With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the\nbuffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,\nthe weather has not been a factor,\" one private consultant said.\n    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoa\nmarket report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likely\nto total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86\ncrop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Bonn is expected to rush through\nlegislation this month creating special credits to protect West\nGerman farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments\nfreeze, government sources said.\n    The new measures are apparently designed to shield West\nGerman farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget\ncrisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC\nexecutive commission's farm policy reform plans, political\nsources said.\n    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint\nsession in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over\nfuture farm financing.\n    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission\nattempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing\nimports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.\nretaliation.\n    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary\nmechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.\n    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right\ncoalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide\ntemporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.\n    The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency\nUnits (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the\nyear, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some\nsubsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states\ntake urgent measures to provide fresh funds.\n    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new\nlegislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to\na farm price package for 1986/87.\n    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the\nsting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies\nby creating a buffer for West German farmers.\n    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and\nallow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of\nthe summer recess, SPD sources said.\n    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party\nwould support the bill, even though it would further swell\nmassive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill\nwas an admission that the government believes the farm price\ntalks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.\n    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,\ngovernment authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1\nbillion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and\npremiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.\n    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.\nBut paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks\n(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.\n    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the\nbill when it meets tomorrow.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Some 6,000 workers would be\nredeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,\nwhile a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retraining\nschemes.\n    The union estimates that the redundancy payments would\ntotal 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while job\nretraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130\nmillion dollars).\n    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the next\nfew years following steep losses incurred by the industry since\nmid-1986.\n    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years was\nunable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar which\ndepressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It actually strengthens the crop to go through\na little stress early on,\" Strommen said.\n    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in\nmost growing areas.\n    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and\nsoybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July\nand August.\n    But because of its early development this year, Strommen\nsaid the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction\nperiod by the first of July.\n    \"Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or\nsoybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the\ndryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,\" an\nanalyst said.\n    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more\nweeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop\nanalysts agreed.\n    August and September are the critical yield-producing\nmonths for soybeans, Strommen said.\n    \"The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive\nduring May, June and July until the August rains which\ndetermine the crop,\" a crop analyst said.\n    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing\nareas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure\nthat there will not be problems later.\n    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather\nforecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal\nprecipitation in much of the corn belt.\n    \"This opens up all sorts of speculation,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with\nmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today\non the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the\n30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for\ndelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set\nlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a\nbushel.\n    \"The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than\nnormal for some time out,\" said David Bartholomew, assistant\nvice president for Merrill Lynch. \"We have probably gone as\nhigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to\nmeasure the euphoria level.\"\n    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,\nposted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit\nin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.\n    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,\nwith December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4\ndlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved\nharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.\n    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean\nplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit\nyoung plants by encouraging the development of deep root\nsystems, Bartholomew said.\n    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to\nactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean\norders went unfilled at the close, traders said.\n    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)\nmeteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not\nsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.\n    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the\ndollar, which can depress prices by making grains more\nexpensive for foreign buyers.\n    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's\nCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle\nsteady.\n    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the\nweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of\ninflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,\nwhich closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.\ntrade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.\n    A USDA report released after trading said the number of\ncattle being fed in seven major producing states was above\nlevels expected by traders. Traders said the report would\nprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange.\n    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52\nmln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade\nforecasts.\n    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,\nup 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off\n93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.\n    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot\nweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said the company has not estimated total\nlost revenue and Cominco spokesmen were not immediately\navailable for comment.\n    The strike, which began May nine, also involves two locals\nthat represent 600 office and technical workers.\n    The production and maintenance workers three weeks ago\nrejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost of\nliving adjustments but no basic wage increase.\n    Each of the five locals has a separate contract that\nexpired April 30, but the main issues are similar.\n    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and\n110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at\nKimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for\nprocessing at the Trail smelter.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The glitter of gold has generated a\nthree-way competition among the world's largest futures\nexchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.\n    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces\ngold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go\ntoe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange\nInc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe\nas the world's precious metals futures capital for\ninstitutional business.\n    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago\nBoard of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending\napplication for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side\nwith the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)\ngold futures.\n    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in\n1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument\nin July 1986.\n    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the\nexchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent\nvolatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the\ndecision may also have been clearing problems in May which\nforced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in\nan effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,\nespecially in silver futures.\n    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for\nother exchanges to successfully offer precious metals\ncontracts, industry sources say.\n    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges\ncan inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume\nof more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to\nbuy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.\n    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold\ncontract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,\nwas under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has\nsurpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.\n    \"The climate could not be better for this venture by the\nCME,\" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil\nMcGarrity.\n    \"Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting\ndaily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.\nThere's good trading volume in all world outlets,\" McGarrity\nadded.\n    \"The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,\nmerchants and customers that there would be a market open for\ntrading,\" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the\nComex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice\npresident and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.\nInc. and a Comex board member.\n    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold\nfutures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York\nwarehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery\nthrough a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member\nof the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies\ndelivery from New York and Chicago vaults.\n    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an\nearlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting\ntime of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start\nallows for trading before many important government reports are\nreleased at 7:30 a.m. CDT.\n    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist\nwith side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be\ngenerated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term\ndebt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge\ntheir financial risks.\n    \"If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy\ngold,\" said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.\n    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold\ntrading. \"Given our night trading session, we could add either\nour pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver\ncontract to attract overseas business,\" a CBT official said.\n    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital\ndoes not appear to be a major issue among professionals.\n    \"We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with\nperhaps different needs,\" Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry\nJarecki said.\n    \"Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid\ncontract. Our firm is no exception,\" Jarecki said.\n    \"At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will\nbe under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing\nprocesses,\" a CME official added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The growing shift of low-skilled\nmanufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border\ncities is not a threat to American employment because it will\nhelp create new markets for products, according to a study\nreleased today.\n    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of\nArizona, which studies international trade issues, said the\nUnited States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing\nin developing countries so that those nations can become\nconsumers of more U.S. goods.\n    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,\nTexas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission\nwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on what\nchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the\nloss of jobs and industry.\n    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from\na trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ\nfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient\ntax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into\nMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that\nare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.\n    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in\nlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changing\ndemographics of the U.S. workforce.\n    \"In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available\nto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be\nbetter educated than prior generations,\" Bolin told reporters in\nMcAllen.\n    \"The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to\nother countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be\nable to fill in the future.\"\n    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged\nby more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the\ntransfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American\nemployment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during\nthe same period, he said.\n    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make up\nmore than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages and\ngenerate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "The dollar should worth more than 170 yen\nbased on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International\nTrade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on\ninternational trade.\n    Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation\ndifferentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth\nquarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.\n    MITI also said the so-called \"J-curve\" and the drop in oil\nprices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6\nbillion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.\n    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose\nto a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.\n    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5\nbillion dlrs and the \"J-curve\" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in\nthe 1986 surplus.\n    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in\nrecent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be\naccounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in\neconomic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36\npct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.\n    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982\nto 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange\nrates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of\nimports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic\ngrowth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other\nminor factors have been left out.\n    \"One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of\nexports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to\nexperience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally\npredisposed to growth in exports,\" MITI said.\n    Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under\nthe impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are\nstepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.\n    Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry\ncited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor\nin the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe,\nreplacing design and brand reputations.\n    \"The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for\nmeasures to address the needs of affected firms,\" it said. \"Whole\nindustries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to\nsuffer.\"\n    \"Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will\nalso be an essential condition,\" the ministry said.\n    It said four structural factors have contributed to the\ngrowth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline\nin U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive\ncapacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies\nand short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.\n    \"While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the\ndollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in\nthe import picture,\" MITI said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Recent quarterly\nfigures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to\nMarch 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.\n    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit\nfor the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion\ndlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Venice summit accord gives the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in\nsmoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial\ncountries, a senior IMF official said.\n    The official, who met reporters but asked not to be\nidentified, made clear that the use of a series of economic\nmeasurements to monitor the seven leading industrial\ndemocracies would be difficult but was a major step in\ncooperation.\n    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,\nItaly and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of\neconomic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an\nattempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.\n    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a\nstep forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised\nbecause it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic\nbehaviour that hurt other countries.\n    But the official said influences and peer pressure could\nhave a major impact in reforming an erring country.\n    Economists generally believe a cooperative economic\napproach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact\non the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor\ncountries.\n    The official said the IMF function would be to warn\ncountries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and\ntry to persuade them to modify it. \"I hope it will be a yellow\nlight, not a red flag,\" he said.\n    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next\nfew weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,\nwhich helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.\n    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currently\nfinanced at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripled\nunder the plan.\n    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very\ndifficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and\nfinding reasons to reduce their own exposure. \"They will be\ntremendously difficult negotiations,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But the question is\nhow long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?\" \nhe said.\n    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up\nprices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no\nquick end to restraint in production.\n    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil\nbecause increased non-OPEC production, combined with\nconservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has\ncaused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Government officials said the worst may be\nover for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger\nthan expected growth in the January/March period.\n    But private economists were not so sure and said the\neconomy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth\nforecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.\n    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March\nquarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three\nmonths. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP\ngrowth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.\n    The government economists acknowledged that the improved\nexport performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to\nbe repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two\npct from the previous three months.\n    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150\nprobably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June\nquarter, they said.\n    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up\ndomestic demand should work as a driving force to push the\neconomy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.\n    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy\nwill achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the\n1987/88 year.\n    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's\nforecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last\nDecember from an original four pct.\n    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for\nhousing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi\nResearch Institute.\n    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in\nnominal income stays low, he added.\n     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter\nwas simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the\npreceding three months, Takahashi said.\n    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but\nthis was primarily because utility companies brought forward\ntheir 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter\nof 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation\npackage announced last fall, he said.\n    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he\nwas unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he\nexpects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.\n    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting\nto rebuild inventories, Furuta said.\n    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower\ninterest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the\nsector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000\nbillion yen economic package will also help the economy.\n    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the\ngovernment's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth\nmight come close to three pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But\nsince the government was struggling to finance tax cuts by\nreducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.\n    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresaw\nredundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland\nplants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel\nmaking sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would\nbe eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies are\nestimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost a\nfurther 240 mln.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of\nrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated\nin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity\nin South Korea.\n    \"Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also\nexpected in 1987,\" Briggs said.\n    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels\nat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with\nachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro\nin Canada.\n    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable\nopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity\nof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.\n    \"Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there\nwill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,\" he\nadded.\n    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of\nzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore\nsupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from\nzinc mines.\n    \"On this basis, our calculations point to a modest\noversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,\" Briggs said.\n    The copper forecast, however, was for a record\nnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,\nincreasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.\n    Production of primary refined copper metal would also\nincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to\na moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes\nthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the\ndecade, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.\n    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last year\nand in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.\n    The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar cane\nfarms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumption\nat 2.03 mln tonnes in calendar 1987.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm\nmarkets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of\nfarm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister\nMutsuki Kato said.\n    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism\nof Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.\n    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade\ntalks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.\n    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme\nexample of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.\nGrowers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports\nexcept in emergency.\n    Kato said Japanese farmers should however \"shed some blood,\"\nto relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.\n    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice\nPrice Council at which the government advisory body will\ndiscuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.\n    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent\nsummit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in\nVenice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) in May.\n    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need\nto cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.\n    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect\nproducers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion\ndlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export\nenhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends\nonly 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the\nworld's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per\nfarm family was several times lower than in the United States.\n    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in\nU.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent\nfarm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a\nfactor increasing protectionism in the United States.\n    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions\nat the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's\nimport restrictions on 12 farm items.\n    Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period from\nnext April are due to start this autumn.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Parliament approved a proposal to drop\nall controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that\nTaiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the\nworld economy.\n    A government spokesman said the new law would be\npromulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and\nfinancial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls\non currency outflows at any time.\n    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year\nwill remain in place, the spokesman said.\n    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls\nwill be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.\n    The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting\ncurrency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange\nreserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have\nled to runaway growth in money supply.\n    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and\nWest Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade\nsurplus and the government fears they are making the island a\ntarget for U.S. Trade protectionism.\n    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs\nin the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it\nwas with the United States.\n    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the\nyear to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.\n    Local bankers and economists say when the controls are\nlifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and\ninvest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations\nof a sudden outflow of capital.\n    \"I don't think we're going to see a big bang,\" John Brinsden,\nthe Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a\nrecent interview.\n    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast\nquantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also\nhave been freely buying and exporting currency through a\nflourishing black-market.\n    \"Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't\nthink it's going to be much,\" said Danny Chan, director of\nFidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.\n    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital\noutflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of\nthe local currency.\n    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the\nU.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of\nspeculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at\n31.08.\n    The government spokesman said the new law does not empower\nauthorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any\nproposal to reimpose them would need the approval of\nparliament.\n    Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted\nit will be almost impossible to reimpose them.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "There should be at least one merger\nbetween major European zinc smelters before the end of the\ndecade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) of\nSMM Penarroya in France, said.\n    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base\nmetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks\nbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result in\nintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990.\n    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag\nAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,\nhave 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.\n    \"We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses\ninto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat\nprice competition and the trend to forward integration from the\nmining companies,\" Bue said.\n    \"It is by no means certain that all the five companies\ninvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite\nlikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form\ntwo or three large integrated blocs.\n    \"In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our\nconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on\nthe other,\" Bue added.\n    In the past, production overcapacity and the intense\ncompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant they\nhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position when\nbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the\nmetal, Bue noted.\n    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut\ndown excess capacity, the burden of this on individual\ncompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to\nvolunteer, he added.\n    Another possible but very risky solution is to invest\nheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.\n    \"My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies\nwho do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest\nmight survive, but only might, \" Bue said.\n    \"The only real option in my mind is integration,\nrationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, \" he\nadded.\n    Bue also said that the European smelters were completely\ndissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and\nmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket\nof the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency\nunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.\n    Bue's views on integration between European smelters were\nmet by general approval from the conference audience comprising\nrepresentatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting\nand trading companies, although some of the mining\nrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own\nindustry's move towards integration with smelters.\n    However, some concentrate traders did express worry about\ntheir own position if the metals industry does make the move to\nlarge trading blocs.\n    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but\nfew said they thought matters would change in the near future.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The EC Commission has proposed a\nmodified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats\nin its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals, an official\ndocument detailing the proposals shows.\n    The document, made available to journalists, says the\ncommission proposes that the tax should start at levels\noriginally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1.\n    However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50\npct from originally envisaged levels, the document said.\n    In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of the\ntax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewed\nevery three months rather than annually.\n    Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for\nfish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to\nthe tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations.\n    Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, West\nGermany and Denmark.\n    The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original\nplans in other sectors.\n    However, they mark the Commission's recognition that it\ncannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for\ncereals, diplomats said.\n    Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly\nincrements applied to cereals during the November to May period\nwhen intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat\nand two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.\n    The document shows the Commission has also changed its\ngreen currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,\nnotably from West Germany.\n    West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatory\namounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with a\nfurther one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season.\n    The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantling\nof positive MCAs.\n     For other countries, the Commission makes the following\nproposals for dismantling negative MCAs\n     Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points for\nanimal products and just over two points for crops.\n     France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for an\nextra 1.5 point cut for beef.\n     Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created since\nJanuary 12.\n    Britain - five point cut for most products, 6.5 points for\nbeef.\n    Greece, Spain and Portugal - for most products, dismantling\nof seven, 14 and 5.5 points respectively.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.\n    The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy\nFarm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.\n    It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a\nloan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK>. It\ndid not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise\nits net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.\n    Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the\nproceeds from the previously announced sale of its office\nbuilding in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.\n    It will consider raising additional capital, most probably\nthrough a placement of convertible preference shares in the\nEuromarket, it added.\n    Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market \"offers\nattractive opportunities for competitively priced food\nretailers\" and that \"a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers\nthe best vehicle to pursue those opportunities.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in\n1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.\n    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87\nfrom 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from\n18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due\nto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as\nArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.\n    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and\nthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.\n    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from\nincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.\n    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against\n528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct\nfrom 2.1 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The New Zealand government is\nforecasting a budget surplus of 379 mln N.Z. Dlrs for the year\nending March 1988, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in a\nstatement.\n    This compares with a deficit of 1.95 billion dlrs in the\nyear ending March 1987 and a 1.87 billion dlr deficit a year\nearlier.\n    Total expenditure is seen at 22.907 billion dlrs against\n20.94 billion in the year to end-March 1987. Total revenue is\nseen at 23.29 billion dlrs against 18.992 billion.\n    The forecast rise in revenue comes partly from the 10 pct\nvalue added goods and services Tax (GST) introduced in October\n1986 which is seen bringing in 4.1 billion dlrs against 1.23\nbillion a year earlier.\n    Other indirect taxation is seen rising to 3.1 billion dlrs\nfrom 2.2 billion. Company tax is forecast to bring in 2.39\nbillion dlrs against 1.22 billion a year earlier while the tax\ntake from individuals is seen little changed at 10.7 billion\ndlrs against 10.9 billion.\n    Excluding revenue and expenditure of a capital nature, such\nas repayment of loans by state-owned enterprises or revenue\nfrom asset sales, the budget would indicate a deficit of 1.27\nbillion dlrs, Douglas said\n    Using this \"financial deficit\" method the deficit in the year\nto end March 1987 was 1.89 billion dlrs, he said.\n    Douglas said using this method, the financial deficit\nforecast for 1987/88 measures 2.2 pct of gross domestic product\nagainst 6.9 pct a year earlier.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "S and W Berisford Plc <BRFD.L> said a six\npct rise in pretax profits to 42.7 mln stg in the first half\nhad maintained last year's momentum despite poor commodities\ntrading conditions and continued rationalisation costs.\n    Its British Sugar Corp Plc unit produced its best ever\nperformance due to greater efficiency and better selling prices\nand was on course for record full year profits.\n    In the last year Berisford attempted to sell the unit and\nattracted several bids. A bid by Hillsdown Holdings Plc\n<HLDN.L> was abandoned, one from Tate and Lyle Plc <TATL.L>\nofficially blocked and a sale of BSC to <Gruppo Ferruzzi> also\nprevented.\n    It had authorised a further 46 mln stg in capital\nexpenditure in BSC for next year, eight mln higher than the\nanticipated total this year.\n    Berisford said it was particularly pleased with the\nprogress of its associate Hunter Saphir Plc, in which it\nacquired a substantial equity stake in January in return for\nthe sale of some of its food manufacturing companies.\n    Since the deal was completed, the market value of the stake\nin Hunter had almost doubled and at the same time enabled the\ngroup to concentrate efforts in its food division on\ningredients -- mainly sugar, gelatine and flavours.\n    The property division maintained good growth while\nfinancial services made a satisfactory contribution to profits.\nHowever, the results of the industrial division continued to be\ndisappointing although the rationalisation programme was\nprogressing well.\n    Commodity operations returned to profit after a second half\nloss last year. The results reflected dull market conditions,\nwith coffee trading failing to repeat last year's exceptional\nfirst half performance due to extremely difficult conditions in\nworld markets.\n    It said it was reducing its exposure to the volatility of\ncommodity earnings by concentrating on a smaller range of key\ncommodities.\n    Berisford shares firmed one penny on the announcement to\n366p.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "The Finance Ministry is putting the\nfinishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary\nbudget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to\nnext year's main budget, ministry officials said.\n    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the\n6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government\nunveiled last month to boost domestic demand.\n    Ministry officials said the government would issue about\n1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the\nincreased public investment set out in the emergency package.\n    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by\n450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in\nNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than\nexpected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.\n    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the\n1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than\n1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted\nreceipts, especially from securities and land taxes.\n    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in\nthe current supplementary budget, the rest will be available\nfor a second supplementary budget expected later this year.\n    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the\ngovernment's wage bill, which will not be known until after\nwage talks later this year, one official said.\n    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than\n1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package\nbut which will not be contained in the first supplementary\nbudget, due to be presented to parliament next month.\n    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax\ncarry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year\nwill be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he\nsaid.\n    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue\ndeficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this\nyear's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.\n    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also\nintends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during\nthe upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.\n    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform\nbill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five\npct sales tax.\n    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in\nindividual and corporate income taxes.\n    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax\ncut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an\noverhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.\n    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax\nbreaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October\nas originally planned, they said.\n    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance\nMinistry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its\nso-called minus ceiling for public investment.\n    That policy calls on government departments to cut public\ninvestment spending by five pct per year.\n    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the\npolicy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation\nfrom the government's administrative reform council.\n    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that\nbudget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be\nreviewed.\n    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau\nsaid they were hopeful the policy would be retained.\n    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public\ninvestment could lead to increased pressure on the government\nto loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.\n    The account would also extend interest-free loans to\nprofitable public works projects developed in conjunction with\nthe private sector, the officials said.\n    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing\npressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a\ntight grip on outlays by other government departments.\n    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could\ntotal about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market\nprice, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more\nthan 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned\nfor in the main 1987/88 budget.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "European Community farm ministers\nplunged the bloc into a crisis today by ending a marathon\nnegotiation on 1987/88 farm prices without agreement.\n    Their chairman, Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker, told a press\nconference this morning ministers gave a majority vote in\nfavour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposal\nintroduced on Tuesday.\n    However, the minority against the crucial plan for a tax on\nvegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block its\nadoption, and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor said\nother aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed.\n    MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of an\nimplicit indication from the West Germans that they were\nprepared to veto two other aspects of the package, the future\nmonetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directly\nconnected with common prices.\n    De Keersmaeker said he will now consider when ministers\nshould be called for further talks, but diplomats said the\noutcome of the meeting makes it almost certain the major\noutstanding issues will be referred to EC heads of government\nwho hold a summit meeting on June 29 and 30 in Brussels.\n    A Commission official said the Commission will work out\nstopgap measures which it will bring in on July 1 if the\ndeadlock persists. These will concern products such as cereals,\ncolza, sugar, beef and milk, for which there would otherwise be\nno legal EC regulations from that date.\n    Trade sources expect these will include a seven pct cut in\nguaranteed prices for most cereals.\n    The official said the measures \"will take into account the\nsituation in the market, but also the EC's severe budgetary\nsituation.\"\n    The Commission was expecting an EC budget deficit this year\nof almost six billion dlrs even before it presented its\ncompromise, which would have cost almost one billion more. It\nestimates the oils and fats tax would bring in 2.3 billion dlrs\nin a full year.\n    Diplomats said Britain, West Germany and the Netherlands\nmaintained their opposition to the tax despite Commission\nattempts to persuade them it would not unfairly hit exports\nfrom countries outside the EC.\n    They added Denmark did not formally state its final\nposition but was understood to remain against.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

He is a popular hero of wars against France and\nthe United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.\n    Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo member\nPham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed the\nViet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.\n    Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter of\neconomic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for the\nless important presidency.\n    That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat who\nranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong was\nmore in tune with the national economic and political changes\nbeing pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upper\nhand in the all-important politburo in December.\n    Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars against\nFrance and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His political\nstance had recently softened, the sources said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The average value of\nthe dollar was 155 yen in the period from 190 a year earlier.\n    Mazda estimated vehicle exports at 1.12 mln, including kit\nparts, in the year to October 31, up 6.8 pct from a year\nearlier, and domestic sales at 360,000, up 0.8 pct, he said.\n    Kit exports should rise because kits sold to Kia Motor Corp\n<KIAM.SE> unit <Kia Industrial Corp>, which is eight pct owned\nby Mazda, and to a Mexico unit of Ford Motor Co <F> will rise\nto 150,000 from 9,000, pushing kit exports up 45.3 pct to\n260,000, he said.\n    Mazda has yet to decide whether to pay an unchanged four\nyen dividend for the second half, but it will pay an unchanged\n3.50 yen for the first half, Wada said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim\npayment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a\nmove aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop\nunder way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.\n    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop\nindicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record\n501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)\ncrop year.\n    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced\n486,790 tonnes.\n    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed\nharvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the\nGovernor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.\n    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make\na payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for\nthe 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers\nfor commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills\nby June 23.\n    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June\n23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.\n    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the\nfull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds\nreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October.\n    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of\n23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to\nthe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled\nFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.\n    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of\n14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the\nforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane\nharvested by November 30, he said.\n    Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of\nthe expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The\nbalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the\nend of crushing.\"\n    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an\nestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)\nfor the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.\nThe FDB rejected this request.\n    Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully\nconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of\nhardship on a case-by-case basis.\"\n    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be\nremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army\nwould restrict its presence in the cane areas.\n    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to\nharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions\nto hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the\ncommencement of harvest.\n    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had\nindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,\nhe added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

We are closely watching the\ngrowth of U.S. Exports, which is an important measure of the\nfundamental strength of the dollar.\" The U.S. Trade deficit's\ndecline in April was due to a 1.2 billion dlr decline in\nimports, while exports did not show a recovery, he said.\n    One life insurance company fund manager said, \"We doubt the\nU.S. Government will fight the trade and fiscal deficits,\nespecially after the announcement of Federal Reserve Board\nchairman Paul Volcker's resignation.\"\n    \"The receptive stance of the U.S. Congress on the call for\nfurther dollar falls to cut the country's trade deficit also\nmakes us wary about U.S. Bonds purchases,\" the life insurance\ncompany fund manager said.\n    Yuji Miyaji, deputy manager of the Sumitomo Trust and\nBanking Co Ltd's securities investment department, said, \"We are\nslowly starting to buy U.S. Bonds because the gap of over 500\nbasis points between the U.S. And Japan is very attractive\nHowever, we are pessimistic on the dollar's further recovery.\nWe find that U.S. Economic fundamentals have not changed so\nfar.\"\n    Keijirou Fukushima, manager at Yamaichi Investment Trust\nManagement Co Ltd's bond portfolio management department, said,\n\"We would like to invest in U.S. Bonds gradually, given an\nimproved inflation outlook and the limited chances of a further\nsteep fall in the dollar from now.\"\n    \"We have already reduced forward dollar selling volume to 40\npct of our total foreign assets from 60 pct,\" he said.\n    Another life insurance company fund manager said, \"We have\nstarted investing in U.S. Treasury securities, but only on a\ntrading basis.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Borrowing through\nbill finance and other sources shrank.\n    The increase in lending in May was seen in most categories,\nthe Banking Information Service said.\n    In the personal sector, on an unadjusted basis, mortgage\nlending rose 544 mln stg compared with 471 mln in April.\nGeneral consumption went up 399 mln against 355 mln, though\ncredit card debt rose only 55 mln compared with 161 mln.\n    Financial sector borrowing was up 734 mln stg in May\ncompared with a net repayment of 60 mln the previous month.\n    Unadjusted private sector deposits increased by 2.37\nbillion stg against 1.16 billion. Sterling attracted an extra\n955 mln stg in deposits from abroad after little change in\nApril.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A commission set up to unravel the\naffairs of debt-ridden Air Lanka says the airline amassed\nlosses of up to 265 mln U.S. Dlrs in \"the most devastating\nfinancial tragedy\" in Sri Lankan commercial history.\n    The commission, which scrutinised financial dealings from\naircraft acquisitions to give-away cookbooks, blamed the\nairline's previous board for the losses. The panel, appointed\nin August by President Junius Jayewardene, submitted its report\nto him on April 20. A copy was obtained by Reuters. The report\nwill be made available to the public by next week.\n    The three-man commission recommended its findings be passed\nto state law officers to decide whether penal action was\nnecessary against any members of the former board or Air\nLanka's management. The airline comes under the Defence\nMinistry, a portfolio held by Jayewardene himself.\n    The commission said Air Lanka's reports to Jayewardene\n\"blurred\" its true financial health. It said the airline had\nirretrievably lost its share capital of 3.8 billion rupees.\n    To finance deficits, it had also used up a treasury loan of\n800 mln rupees and part of foreign currency loans obtained for\naircraft purchases and infrastructure needs, it said.\n    \"Air Lanka is thus indebted to overseas lenders to the value\nof one billion rupees without any productive assets or\ncollateral to provide for its repayment,\" the commission said.\n    It said the airline's losses were assessed at 5.59 billion\nrupees at March 31, 1986. But cumulative losses would reach 7.7\nbillion, implying Air Lanka lost money at the rate of 1.3\nbillion rupees a year between 1979, when it started, and 1986.\n    \"These results must rank as the most devastating financial\ntragedy ever suffered in Sri Lanka's commercial history,\" the\ncommission said.\n    The report said the airline's dangerously critical\nfinancial condition was due to uncontrolled spending --\nparticularly the way in which the airline expanded its fleet --\npoor marketing, and extreme laxity in cost controls.\n    \"It is clear to us that Air Lanka's misfortunes are largely\nof its own creation and that the reponsibility must rest\nprimarily with the board of directors,\" it said.\n    Air Lanka had blamed its problems on the effects on tourism\nof Sri Lanka's Tamil separatist rebellion, the depreciating\nrupee and under-capitalisation. The commission dismissed these\nas invalid.\n    The report said most of the major problems stemmed from\nconcentration of power by Captain S.R. Wikramanayake who held\nthe posts of both chairman and managing director.\n    \"It is mainly he who has to be responsible for whatever the\nstatus of Air Lanka is in today,\" it said.\n    Wikramanayake resigned with the other board members last\nNovember. He could not be contacted for comment.\n    The commission recommended that its findings should be\npassed \"to the law officers of the state ... To ascertain if\npenal action is necessary against any or all members of the\nformer board of Air Lanka or its management staff.\"\n    The panel recommended equity involvement of one or more\nforeign airlines in Air Lanka and the granting of maximum\nconcessions to make the carrier attractive to foreign and local\ninvestment. It also suggested selling assets, such as two\nBoeing 747s financed by U.S. Dollar loans, to reduce debt.\n    It said Air Lanka and the government should renegotiate\nU.S. Dollar-denominated debts into other currencies which form\nthe core of earnings and obtain lower interest rates. It also\nproposed negotiations for the return of two Lockheed Tristar\nL1011-500s now leased to British Airways before the leases\nexpire next March.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "BankAmerica Corp <BAC> asked Japanese\ncommercial banks today to buy 350 mln dlrs in subordinated\ncapital notes and preferred stock that it plans to issue to\nboost its equity base, a company spokesman said.\n    BankAmerica vice chairman Frank N. Newman held a meeting\nhere today to outline its fund-raising plan to some 20 Japanese\nbanks, he told Reuters.\n    He also stressed the company's efforts to streamline\noperations, by withdrawing from unprofitable energy-related\nareas to concentrate more on its Californian home base.\n    But Newman said the company had no intention of selling its\n Seafirst Corp Subsidiary in Washington.\n    A document obtained by Reuters shows the fund-raising\neffort involves 250 mln dlrs in 12-year subordinated capital\nnotes and 100 mln in convertible preferred stock.\n    It has made a shelf registration with the SEC so that it\ncan issue debt securities whenever market conditions are\nfavorable.\n    The company already raised 100 mln dlrs in the U.S. Market\nlast month, he added.\n    According to the document, the 250 mln dlrs in subordinated\ncapital notes will carry an interest rate of 100 basis points\nover the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The\nminimum rate will be six pct and the maxiumum 12 pct.\n    The notes will be redeemable at par after four years and\nwill also have warrants attached to purchase the firm's common\nstock at 17.50 dlrs. There will be 7.5 mln warrants in all,\nwith a term of 10 years.\n    The planned convertible preferred stock will carry a\ndividend rate equivalent to three months LIBOR plus an as yet\nundecided premium, the document said. There will be no sinking\nfund for the preferred stock, which will have 10-year warrants\nattached to buy BankAmerica common stock.\n    The rest of the details of the preferred stock issue have\nyet to be worked out.\n    On both the preferred stock and note issues, BankAmerica\nsaid that a fixed rate alternative was possible.\n    The document said that BankAmerica was also open to raising\nfunds in yen, if that was desirable for the Japanese.\n    Those present at the meeting today were working-level\nofficials from 13 city, three long-term credit and seven trust\nbanks, Japanese banking sources said.\n    Newman expressed hope that certain banks would act as lead\nmanagers of the projected debt securities but did not name\nspecific banks, the sources said. No bank made any commitment\nto the company's fund-raising plan as most knew little about it\nin advance, they said.\n    \"Today's meeting itself was held with very short-notice and\nwe just can't decide what to do with it,\" said a senior official\nat a leading city bank.\n    Newman attempted to quell Japanese bankers' fears that the\nU.S. Federal Reserve may insist that they deduct the equivalent\namount to the securities purchased  from their primary capital,\nunder a regulation now being studied by the U.S. And Britain.\n    Newman told them that they should not worry because he\nunderstood the U.S. Federal Reserve would not go along with\nsuch a regulation, the official said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

It lifted annual dividend to 24 cents\nfrom 22 with a final of 13, against 11 previously.\n    Hardie had concentrated resources on building up its core\nbusinesses of building products, paper merchanting and\ntechnology and services, it said in a statement.\n    Hardie said it sold a number of businesses during the year\nwhich were unable to meet objectives for return on investment\nor market share and some non-core units.\n    This resulted in a decline in sales to 1.50 billion dlrs\nfrom 1.56 billion, but also contributed to a fall of about 100\nmln dlrs in borrowings by year-end and a 36 pct drop in\ninterest expense to 29.16 mln dlrs, it said.\n    Hardie said a 42 pct jump in second-half net earnings to\n29.66 mln dlrs from 20.92 mln a year earlier was particularly\npleasing in view of the difficult trading conditions faced by\nthe building products businesses in Australia.\n    The problems in U.S. Irrigation operations which adversely\naffected 1985/86 earnings have been overcome, Hardie said.\n    It said the process of rationalisation and consolidation\nhad continued into the current year as had expansion into the\nU.S.\n    Hardie said it could now look forward to a period of\ndevelopment and further growth in Australia and overseas after\ncarrying through a long and expensive process of eliminating\nasbestos, the group's original prime raw material, from its\nfibre cement building products over the past eight years.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

However, he said he did not expect any quick\nsolution to the subsidy problem.\n    Clark said Canadian farmers, like those of ASEAN, \"are\ncaught in the cross-fire of an agricultural subsidy war that is\nnot of our making.\"\n    Clark said his country will provide 10 mln Canadian dlrs as\naid over thu next five years to developing countries of the\nSouth Pacific region to finance fisheries and other marine\nprojects.\n    \"The new program, which we estimate will cost about two mln\nCanadian dlrs a year, will be implemented by t\u007fe International\nCentre for Ocean Development (ICOD) in close cooperation with\nthe major South Pacific regional organisations,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Private Export Funding Corp, PEFCO, is\noffering 150 mln dlrs of secured notes due 1994 with an 8.60\npct coupon and par pricing, said J.P. Morgan Securities Inc,\nacting as lead manager of its first corporate debt deal.\n    \"To our knowledge, this is the first time that an affiliate\nof a bank holding company has been a manager of a corporate\nbond offering in the U.S.,\" a spokesman for J.P. Morgan and Co\nInc said.\n    J.P. Morgan Securities is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan and\nCo, the fifth largest bank in the U.S.\n    The J.P. Morgan spokesman explained that because the PEFCO\nnotes are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the securities\naffiliate was not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act from\nunderwriting the issue.\n    Indeed, Bankers Trust Co and Citicorp Investment Bank,\nwhich are affiliates of Bankers Trust New York Corp and\nCiticorp respectively, were co-managers of the PEFCO offering.\n    Passed by Congress in 1933, Glass-Steagall bars commercial\nbanks from owning brokerage firms and engaging in such\ninvestment banking activities as underwriting corporate\nsecurities or municipal revenue bonds.\n    Last year, several major U.S. banks formed investment\nbanking affiliates and applied to the Federal Reserve Board for\nauthorization to offer commercial paper and underwrite and\ntrade municipal revenue bonds and some forms of mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n    J.P. Morgan Securities received permission from the Fed\nseveral weeks ago for these activities, the spokesman said.\n    But the Securities Industry Association, a trade group of\ninvestment banking firms, appealed the decision. J.P. Morgan\nalso appealed because it believed the Fed placed too many\nrestrictions on the bank's affiliate, the spokesman said.\n    \"The Securities and Exchange Commission got a stay, so we\nare not engaging in those activities,\" the J.P. Morgan\nspokesman said.\n    \"We are perfectly eligable to underwrite this offering. We\nare endeavoring to prove that there is nothing mysterious about\nthis business,\" the spokesman said.\n    He added, \"Ruling off certain markets does not serve the\npublic policy.\n    J.P. Morgan Securities was formed in April 1986 with\ncapitalization of 250 mln dlrs, the spokesman said. At year-end\n1986, the firm had 261.5 mln dlrs of capital.\n    Dillon, Read and Co Inc, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and\nSalomon Brothers Inc also served as co-managers of the PEFCO\ndeal.\n    The issue's yield was 50 basis points over comparable\nTreasury securities. The notes are non-callable for life. A\ntop-flight AAA rating by Moody's and Standard and Poor's is\nanticipated.\n    The gross spread is 5.75 dlrs, the selling concession is\n3.50 dlrs and the reallowance is two dlrs.\n    The spokesman said J.P. Morgan Securities was a member of\nan underwriting syndicate for a Sallie Mae issue last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L>\nsaid it looked to further progress this year after reporting a\n11.7 pct rise in 1986/87 pretax profits to 2.07 billion stg.\n    The result was at the top end of market expectations but\nthe shares nonetheless declined from last night's closing\nlevels to stand 12p lower at 303p at 1130 GMT.\n    Telephone call income rose 9.5 pct to 4.97 billion while\nrental income increased 10.6 pct to 3.06 billion.\n    The company said it had not paid anything through its\nprofit-sharing scheme, after 18 mln stg last year, considering\nsuch payments inappropriate after a series of strikes.\n\n    It said total operating costs rose 806 mln stg to 7.08\nbillion while its basket of across-the-range tariffs had been\nreduced overall by 0.3 pct last November under arrangements set\nup before privatisation.\n    Despite the rise in profits, taxation rose only 11 mln stg\nto 754 mln, reflecting the cut in U.K. Corporation tax to 35\npct from 40 pct during the year. Gearing fell to 33 pct from 39\npct. Price regulation formulae were introduced for both the\npreviously state-owned utilities that have been floated off.\nYesterday, British Gas Plc <BRGS.L> said it was cutting tariffs\nfor domestic customers by about 4.5 pct.\n    BT chairman Sir George Jefferson said work on new digital\nexchanges and optical fibre links will continue and the fight\nagainst vandalism of public call boxes would go on.\n    \"We have been spending 160 mln stg over three years\nmodernising and expanding our payphone service to make our call\nboxes more reliable and harder to vandalise.\"\n    Expenditure on digital exchanges was about 500 mln stg and\nprogress had been made in installing optical fibre.\n\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "European coffee traders and roasters\nmay propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee\nOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting\nhere this week, traders and officials told Reuters.\n    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the\npossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the\nworld's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the\nnext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.\n    \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's\nattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said.\n    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,\nwhich began here today and is to continue to the end of the\nweek, has revealed gaps in the European position on\nre-introducing quotas.\n    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against\nre-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in\nfavour with the single proviso that there had to be some\nformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing\ncountries.\n    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly\nclose, and problems with some Government officials.\n    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized\nGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.\n    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota\nre-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.\n    \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the\nend of the week to at least present a common European Community\n(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the\nInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said.\n    \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not\nonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\"\none official said.\n    \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that\nwere suspended in February last year, but would prefer the\nstability they can bring to the market as long as we do not\nsimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as\nquota allocation is concerned,\" he added.\n    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the\nlikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly\npessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.\n    \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the\nconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota\nre-introduction, \" he said.\n    \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new\nBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least\nnegotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader\nsaid.\n    \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of\nthe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under\na new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which\ngives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota\nmeeting in September,\" the official said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The subsidies were\nneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,\nexporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as\nassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.\n    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers\nshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said the\ngovernment would continue to maintain production targets for\n\"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar.\n    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's\ndrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double\nthe world average because of inefficiencies, and the country\nwould save money by importing the commodity.\n    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need\nto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar\nindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.\n    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the\nagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry\ndevelop and because of \"over-production and price intervention\nin the developed nations.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S. House and Senate budget\nnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached\nyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending\non agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.\n    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4\nbillion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.\n    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the\nfarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a\ntotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.\n    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture\ncommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes in\nagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets\nwithout jeopardizing popular support payments, senior\nCongressional aides told Reuters.\n    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find\nthe budget savings.\n    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\nsubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\nand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\nand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\nsaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\nbe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\na strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\nfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\ngrain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\nsavings Glickman claims.\n    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\nsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\nARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\nwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\nwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\npct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\ncommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\nsignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\nthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\nsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\nunfair to one commodity.\n    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\nlikely to eventually look for budget savings are some\ntightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \nadoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\nbut not enough, they said.\n    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\ncommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\nall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\nsupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\nFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Some OPEC states are unhappy about the\nprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\ngreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\nand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\n    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\npresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\nabout price differentials making some of their crudes\nuncompetitive.\n    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\nOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\nto correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\n    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\ndifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\nsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\n    \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\ndifferentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But\nat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well\nalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"\n    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\nsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\ncustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\nmarketing incentives have helped their sales.\n    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\nmeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\nbetter priced grades in a \"package.\"\n    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\nfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\nchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\nfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\nits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\nprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\npoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\nwhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\n    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\nmln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\nand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\nor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\nmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\ntarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\nanalysts say.\n    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\nnon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\ncrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\nExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\nexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\nonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\nofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\nor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\nwhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\npay the new prices.\n   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\nwas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\nits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\ndue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\nrisen.\n    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\nits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\nGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\ndifferentials question in Vienna.\n    \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\nholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Analysts said they were surprised at\nthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for\nfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy\nstatements and positive for the economy.\n    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus\nfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs\nagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.\n    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus\nwas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'\nforecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.\n    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters\nbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a\n2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.\n    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and\nthe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,\nthe New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite\nlower interest rates, as overseas investors became more\nconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said.\n    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying\nthe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will\nmove lower.\n    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after\nhours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget\nrelease.\n    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share\nmarket, despite an increase in the contribution of company\ntaxation to revenue figures.\n    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus\nannouncement could push the share market up by 50 points\ntomorrow.\n    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a\ncontinuation of existing policies, and the absence of\ntraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively\nby overseas investors, another said.\n    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax\navoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share\nmarket, particularly multi-national companies.\n    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,\nthrough bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The\nrequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln\nN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.\n    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and\nthere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another\neconomist said. He added that the document seemed entirely\ncredible.\n    \"Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,\"\nhe said.\n    An election is due before the end of September.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Dutch butter consumption rose at the\nexpense of margarine last year partly because of the European\nCommunity's (EC) cheap butter schemes, the Commodity Board for\nMargarine, Fats and Oils (MVO), said.\n    Butter consumption rose to 4.1 kilos per head in 1986 from\nfour kilos in 1985, while margarine consumption including low\nfat margarine, fell to 14 kilos per head from 14.3 kilos.\n    The low fat margarine figure remained static at 2.6 kilos\nper head, while ordinary margarine fell from 11.7 kilos per\nhead to 11.4 kilos.\n    However, cheap butter schemes may not be the only\ncontributory factor in the changes. The MVO figures show a\nfairly steady rise in total butter consumption and fall in\nmargarine consumption since 1973.\n    A graph produced in the MVO annual report shows total Dutch\nmargarine consumption in 1973 at just under 210,000 tonnes\nagainst around 165,000 in 1986.\n    The same graph shows total butter consumption in 1973 at\njust over 30,000 tonnes compared with just short of 60,000\ntonnes last year.\n    However, during the same period total Dutch edible fat and\noil consumption on a fat content basis has risen from around\n345,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes, or an average of 24.8 kilos\nper head in 1986.\n    The graph shows that most of the increase has come from\nbutter and household cooking oil usage.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

The subsidies were\nneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,\nexporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as\nassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.\n    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers\nshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said the\ngovernment would continue to maintain production targets for\n\"strategic commodities\" such as rice and sugar.\n    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's\ndrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double\nthe world average because of inefficiencies, and the country\nwould save money by importing the commodity.\n    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need\nto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar\nindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.\n    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the\nagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry\ndevelop and because of \"over-production and price intervention\nin the developed nations.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed\nthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the current\nnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.\n    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing\nproduction data showed that the economy is still strong and\ndoes not need a fillip from lower rates.\n    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,\ntaken together with higher than expected bank lending and money\nsupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist\narguments against easier credit, they said.\n    \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back\nall the while. The strength of the economy and broad money\ngrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the near\nterm,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.\n    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's\nmortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies\nsaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.\nRates.\n    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that\na post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such\noptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which\nmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's\nstrength.\n    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm\nabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment\nrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly\nreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying\naverage earnings in April, dealers said.\n    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending\nrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank\nof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset\nthe impact on domestic money supply of its current\nintervention.\n    \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin,\nchief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.\n    \"That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very\ngood state indeed,\" Skeoch said.\n    \"There's no reason to get worries about inflationary\npressures because they're very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises\nwere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to\nApril, and it was these costs rather than average earnings\nwhich were potentially inflationary, he added.\n    \"I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major\nproblem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.\n    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried\nabout the funding implications of recent intervention.\n    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets\nearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that\nthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now\nlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try\nto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.\n    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson\nSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would still\ntrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal\nhigher inflation this year.\n    \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As\nlong as that continues we're okay,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a\nspin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could\ngain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts\nestimated.\n    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on\nrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on\nabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was\nvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.\n    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement\naround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of\nthe unit, leading investors to take profits.\n    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,\nclosing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.\n    \"It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat\ndisappointing,\" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He\nsaid rumors of the spin-off had been around \"for a couple of\ndays.\"\n    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't\ngetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its\nvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price.\n    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said\nthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and\nhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.\n    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says\nchemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about\nthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500\nto 600 mln dlrs.\n    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake\nbecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the\ncompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt.\n    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall\nthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been\npresented to its board.\n    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion\ndlrs.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

It said interest only is payable until\nJune 1, 1990, when repayment of principal in 20 quarterly\ninstallments.\n    Sykes said the remaining 250,000 dlrs of each commitment\nmay be drawn down at Sykes' option after December 1, 1987 if\nthe company has met certain performance levels.\n    It said the debentures are convertible into common stock at\n15 cts per share.  It said if it has now drawn all of the\nremaining 500,000 dlrs of debentures, the investor can buy\nwhatever amount of debentures remain unsold and immediately\nconvert  them to Sykes stock.\n    Sykes said if both investors were to convert all of the\ndebentures, they would own 13.3 mln Sykes shares.  Sykes now\nhas 13.0 mln shares outstanding.\n    Sykes said, however, that the agreement with the investors\nprovides that the number of shares resulting from the\nconversion of the debentures may not be in an amount that would\nlimit Sykes' ability to use its net operating loss carryforward\nunder the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The provisioin would\nprevcent the investor from owning more than 50 pct of Sykes'\nshares immediately after conversion, it said.\n    The company said closing of the trasaction is expected\nbefore July 1, subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion\nfrom an investment banker, Moseley Holdings Corp <MOSE.O>.\n    Sykes said it will use 1,100,000 dlrs of the initial\n1,500,000 dlrs in proceeds, together with a 200,000 dlr note,\nto pay in full all its debt to Chase and Chemical.  The banks\nwill then release their security interests in sykes assets,\nwhich will be pledged to the two new investors instead, it\nsaid.\n    Sykes said on payment to the banks, it will no longer have\nto pay to the banks lease payments and proceeds from the sale\nof excess inventory and assets.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "West Germany's proposed tax reform should\nbe brought forward to stimulate economic growth and head off\nU.S.-led pressure on Bonn to take further fiscal steps to help\nboost the world economy, the Ifo economic institute said.\n    An Ifo report said, \"The total growth effect of the reform\ncould be considerably enhanced, and international pressure on\nthe government therefore reduced, if a larger portion of the\ntax cuts planned by 1990 were brought forward to 1988.\"\n    Swift action is required to remove growing doubts about how\nthe 44 billion mark tax reform will be financed, Ifo said.\n    The report says the tax reform will be insufficient and too\nlate to stimulate economic growth, as demanded by West\nGermany's industrial partners.\n    Since the lion's share of cuts worth a gross 44 billion\nmarks \"will not go into effect before 1990, their impact on\ngrowth will be too little, too late,\" said Ifo.\n    The West German government has consistently said that by\ncutting taxes and encouraging consumer spending it is boosting\ndomestic demand and making a significant contribution to world\neconomic growth.\n    Bonn has agreed to increase the scope of tax reductions\nplanned for 1988. In March, the government said 1988 tax cuts\nwould be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.\n    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemann\ncountered a joint call from all five German economic institutes\nto speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endanger\nefforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowing\ndown.\n    Financing the tax reform has become an \"acute problem,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    \"Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comes\nup against political opposition. There will be a lot more\ncriticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed to\nfinance the reform has been accounted for,\" the report said.\n    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how to\nraise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.\nSubsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.\n    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,\neconomics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,\nhave conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marks\nare unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to be\nfound.\n    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to help\nfinance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope with\nthis, the report said.\n    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, the\njunior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonn\nwill eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) due\nto tax harmonisation measures within the European Community. A\nVAT increase will also provide funds for income tax reform, the\nreport said.\n    Viewed in the context of efforts by Bonn, Washington and\nTokyo to reform taxes, \"despite its various shortcomings, West\nGermany's planned tax reform is better than its reputation,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    The effective cut in the income tax burden carried by West\nGermans will be greater than in the U.S., Although the rate\nreductions are smaller and income tax levels will remain higher\noverall, the report said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

        "body": "A spokesman for the European\nCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy\non oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help\nalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.\n    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's\nDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils\nand Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the\nsacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in\nthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to\nmake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem\nwithin that sector by paying a levy.\"\n    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of\nbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds\nproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.\n    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European\nCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0\nbillion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"\nagreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\nfeel the full impact of its enlargement.\n    The Commission has proposed several cost and production\ncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\nguaranteed quantity system, he added.\n    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\nprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\nEcus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\nsaid.\n    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\namount when market prices are below or above this level.\n    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\namount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\nPolicy's oils and fats regime.\n    \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\nproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\nor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.\n    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\n    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\nto domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\nit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\n    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\nunder present aid arrangements, he said.\n    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\nproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\nimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\nTanghe said.\n    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\nrequirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\neffect would stabilise Community production levels without\naffecting demand, he said.\n    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\nimport levels, he said.\n    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\nimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\nrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\nFurthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\nbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Indonesia expects the recent years'\nrise in its debt service ratio to peak at the current level of\n41 pct, Development Supervision Minister Ali Wardhana told\njournalists.\n    He was speaking at a news conference following a two day\nannual meeting of aid donors grouped in the Inter-Governmental\nGroup on Indonesia (IGGI) in which 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh\nfunds were pledged for the coming year.\n    \"The current debt service ratio of 41 pct will be the top,\"\nWardhana said, noting the debt service ratio rose to that level\nfrom 37 pct last year. Indonesia's debt totals 37 billion dlrs.\n    \"The current debt burden will be manageable if concessionary\nloans can be attracted,\" he said.\n    He said international organisations such as the World Bank\npledged an unchanged 1.68 billion dlrs in fresh funds to\nIndonesia and this year's overall total, up from last year's\n2.6 billion, reflected higher pledges from donor countries.\n    He said Japan raised its pledge to 88 billion yen from 80\nbillion last year. Britain almost trebled its contribution to\n130 mln stg from 45 mln. The United States raised its\ncontribution to 190 mln dlrs from 86 mln and the Netherlands\nraised its figure to 232 mln guilders from 180 mln.\n    Commenting on the increase in funds pledged to Indonesia,\nwhich has been hard hit in export revenue due to the oil price\ncollapse, Wardhana said, \"I am happily surprised, but in view of\nthe seriousness of the balance of payments situation the amount\nis what we needed to cope.\"\n    He noted donors pledged to increase local cost financing as\npart of the aid package. Some 900 mln dlrs of the package will\nbe for programme aid or local cost financing, Indonesian\nCentral Bank Governor Arifin Siregar said.\n    Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said Indonesia will continue\nto reform the economy and bring about further liberalisations.\n    \"Indonesia has undertaken reforms to meet external problems,\"\nSaleh said. \"It's a good thing and we will continue with\nderegulation in trade, industry and licensing of new\nbusinesses.\"\n    Asked whether the question of private capital exports from\nIndonesia was discussed, central bank governor Arifin Siregar\nexpressed confidence that any drain of capital abroad would\nonly be temporary.\n    He noted there had been a turnaround in a recent fall in\nforeign exchange reserves three days ago.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

The oils are soybean,\ncottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and\npalm.\n    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were\nunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current\nseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago\nand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.\n    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start\nof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by\nthe end of next season.\n    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last\nOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at\nthe end of next season, Mielke said.\n    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the\ncourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in\nsoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln\ntonnes or by one fifth.\n    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,\nfor which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln\ntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks\nof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this\nseason.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

He said the\ncompany has no plans to turn its back on the Woolworth stores.\n    \"We've spent alot of money on refurbishing and remodeling\nour general merchandise stores, and we will continue to do so,\"\nhe said.\n    Sells said the number of general merchandise stores is not\nincreasing. But one of the companies stratagies is to increase\nits core departments in the general merchandise stores into\nspecialty stores, he said.\n    He said these include its framescene and cosmetics unit.\n    He said the company continues to look at mergers and\nacquisitions. But he stressed any acquisitions should make\nsense from a strategy standpoint.\n    \"We're primarily looking for small, emerging growth stores\nwith a concept that's right to expand on national scale,\" he\nsaid.\n   \n   Sells said the company has been looking at a number of\ninitial experiments on home video sales. He said Woolworth will\nbecome involved this summer with J.C.

The United States asked for\nconsultations with Tokyo on the issue.\n    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a\npolitical commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,\npledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.\n    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to\nnegotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT\nsurveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT\njargon as \"standstill and rollback.\"\n    Tran criticised Washington for the \"superfund\" tax on oil\nimports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special\nmachine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government\nprocurement list for reasons of national security.\n    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the\npolicies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.\n    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks\nto the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,\nto decide any further action on the charges.\n    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the\nsubject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the\nUruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.\n    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's\nreport and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports\nbreached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its\nlegislation.\n    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,\nbrought the dispute to the GATT last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping\nto achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a\nyear in the next few years despite low world prices,\ndeteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry\nofficials said.\n    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has\nintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure\nthe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.\n    Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia\nConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year\nended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a\nrecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.\n    \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial\nyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due\nto greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM\nofficial said.\n    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another\nstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.\n    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes\nhigher than the previous year and the best production achieved\nto date.\n    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper\nindustry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\nlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\nby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\n    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\nmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\nsaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\npart of the plan.\n    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\nindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\nthe five-year restructuring plan.\n    Company officials said although reserves were being\ndepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\nend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\nthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\nkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\nstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\nsent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\nTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\nfuel.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Revenue would provide\n48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to\nbe financed through domestic and foreign loans.\n    This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only\n3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to\nimpose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No\nfigure for the final deficit was avaialble.\n    The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with\neffect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30\npct.\n    Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar\nincreases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would\nrise by 75 pct.\n    The higher levies affect official transactions such as road\ntolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But they were isolated to just a small portion of the\nWest Texas area, probably less than five pct,\" Mohler said.\n    \"No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July\nor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been\nworse,\" Mohler said.\n    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been\nplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if\nweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.\n    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about\n95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier\nthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "A compromise reached between Gulf Canada\nCorp and debenture holders at the annual meeting today will\ncost the company or its major shareholder \"a couple of million\"\ndollars, chairman Marshall Cohen said.\n    After about a half-hour discussion with debenture holders\nduring the meeting, Cohen and Gulf lawyers agreed to compensate\nthem for about six months of interest that they would have lost\nunder a corporate reorganization plan taking effect July one.\nThe holders then withdrew a proposed amendment that sought to\ndelay the plan's closing to July 16 so they could collect\ninterest due to be paid July 15.\n    \"We have not sorted out the mechanics of how we're going to\ndo this,\" Cohen told reporters later.\n    \"It may well be that in the end the principal shareholder\nmay absorb that interest,\" he said, referring to the Reichmann\nfamily's Olympia and York Developments Ltd, which owns about 79\npct of Gulf Canada.                                     Cohen\nsaid he wanted to ensure that Gulf Canada need not revise\nreorganization proposals already on file with Revenue Canada\nand the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n    \"If Gulf can't pay it (the interest) without upsetting the\napplecart, Olympia and York will pay,\" he said.\n    The reorganization will see Gulf Canada Corp renamed Gulf\nCanada Resources Ltd. Shareholders will be offered shares of\nthree separate publicly traded companies, Gulf Canada\nResources, Abitibi-Price Inc <A.TO> and GW Utilities Ltd.\n    Newly formed GW Utilities will hold Gulf Canada's interests\nin Consumers' Gas Co Ltd <CGT.TO>, Hiram Walker-Gooderham and\nWorts Ltd and Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd <IPL.TO>.\n    Cohen said Olympia and York's interest in Gulf Canada\nResources will slip to about 68 or 69 pct as a result of a\npreviously announced plan to sell 450 mln dlrs of new stock.\n                             \n    In answer to a reporter's question, Cohen said there was a\npossibility that the size of the offering could be increased.\n    \"There seems to be pretty strong interest,\" he said, but he\nadded that much depended upon market conditions at the time of\npricing. The issue will be priced later this month, according\nto a company official.\n  \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas\nutility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of\nTransco Energy Co's <E> decision to close its pipelines to\ntransport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.\n    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the\nUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or\nnon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot\nsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,\nanalysts said.\n    Texas Eastern pipelines <TET>, the other competing\npipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South\nclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has\nrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.\n     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs\nper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas\ncosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.\n    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open\naccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear\nof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.\n    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for\ngas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.\n    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of\nsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a\nBrooklyn Union official said.\n    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through\nto rate payers.\n    While net effect on the company will not be known for\nseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,\nend-users, especially residential and commercial customers,\nwill end up paying more for gas, he said.\n    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas\ndemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be\nsmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\nJenrette, said.\n    If the situation persists into winter heating season, high\ncost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.\n    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for\nspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co <NCNG>,\nPiedmont Natural Gas Co <PNY>, will face the same high cost\nfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with\nend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering\nfirm, said.\n    \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the\ntake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said.\n    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request\nfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility\nfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.\n    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will\nthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to\nalternative fuels, he said.\n    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being\nnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.\n    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas\nfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory\non the inventory charge, he said.\n    \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may\ntake a while.\"\n       \n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Shares of Glaxo Holdings PLC fell\nfollowing a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine\nthat antibiotics may be able to treat ulcers, threatening \nGlaxo's billion dlr antiulcer drug Zantac, analysts said.\n    Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of\n1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman <SKB>, maker of\nthe popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.\n    \"Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely new\ntherapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwide\nbusiness, which is Zantac,\" said David MacCallum, an analyst\nwho follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.\n   \n    Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annual\nsales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pct\nof Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.\n    \"If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapy\nof choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline,\"\nsaid Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing and\nOr'kshnk.\n    Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by a\nUniversity of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71\nchildren with gastric disease that bacteria could cause\ngastritis and ulcers.\n   \n    In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal,\nRichard Hornick of the University of Rochester School of\nMedicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers.\nRizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcer\nrelationship is \"exciting and intriguing,\" but further studies\nare needed to show a direct causal effect.\n    Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodes\nand is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknown\nwhat actually causes the process.\n   \nIt is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and therefore\nantacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagamet\nand Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the release\nof the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acid\nsecretion.\n    \"I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo,\" said\nanalyst Rizopuolos. \"It will take a long time to displace\nTagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed by\nphysicians for a long time,\" she added.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Court does not sit tomorrow.\n    In essence the Council is claiming that its status is\nsimilar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can\ntherefore not be used in an English court of law.\n    The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of\nschedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow\nwhen the European Community's legal advisers were due to\nattend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various\nlegal actions today.\n    Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal\nadministrative matters, delegates said.\n    The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after\nJune 30 following the two year extension of the sixth\nInternational Tin Agreement.\n    As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council\nwill continue with its statistical work and carry out some\nresearch studies, although staffing in the research department\nis being cut to one from two previously.\n    At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes\nof Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members\nand Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the\nconsumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions\nare scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group\nInc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette\nCo that could draw some big international players and in the\nprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts\nsaid.\n    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of\ndirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested\nconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per\nshare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\nNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n    \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\nmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\nto make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\ndescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\ntakeover target.\n    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\ngets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\nNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\nshare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\nthree yesterday.\n    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\nPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\nsplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\ncompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\nmln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\nreturned telephone calls seeking comment.\n    \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\nsomeone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\nMerrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\nbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\ndlrs per share.\"\n    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\nwhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\nGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\nprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\nyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\noperations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\nthe dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\nhas recently made two other acquisitions.\n    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\nsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\nCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\nGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,\nRJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston\nPurina Co <RAL>.\n    \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\nWall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\ncompany is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\nto resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\nconsenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\nsaid.\n   \n    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n\"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\ncalculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to\nbe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\nshareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\nthree and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\nGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\nagreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank\nN.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial\nadviser.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Robins Co, facing suits over its\nDalkon Shield birth control device, said a Federal Court of\nAppeals approved of the way the company notified potential\nvictims about a possible liability.\n    The notification of potential claimants, which began in\njanuary 1986 and ended several months later, was challenged by\nsome claimant committees who said the company's program was\ninadequate.\n    A company spokesman said A.H. Robins was pleased with the\nruling, noting an unfavorable decision would have \"set the\nwhole thing back for quite some time.\"\n    The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the fourth\ncircuit, which upheld a lower court, said, \"the notification\nprogram used by Robins was ... reasonable.\n    \"The evidence indicates that every news outlet in the world\nreceived the information. Simiarly, there is strong evidence\nthat the news was broadly disseminated worldwide.\n    \"Women from such unlikely locations as Kenya, Botswana,\nPakistan and Bangladesh ultimately filed claims. A battery of\nworld health and welfare organizations also disseminated the\ninformation. It appears to this Court that the extensive\nnotification program was a success.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It has become evident that SDI\nparticipation may not be the great bonanza that some thought.\"\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been one of\nPresident Reagan's few staunch supporters on his plan to\ndevelopment an anti-ballistic missile defence screen.\n    But government sources said she has become angry about\nbureaucratic barriers to British companies trying to break into\nthe lucrative American defence market generally -- a view\nvoiced again today by her defence minister, George Younger.\n    He told a gathering here of British and American\nbusinessmen, \"We in Europe greatly welcome the emphasis which\nyou in the U.S. Have placed on cooperation and collaboration in\nthe defence equipment sphere.\"\n    He added, \"But I do worry that the failure of important and\ninfluential individuals in Congress and elsewhere to realise\nthe true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas,\ntechnology and equipment will lead to the erection of\nartificial barriers.\"\n    \"I am afraid that the danger signals are only too visible in\nthe form of both of the legislative proposals which seem to\narise with ever increasing frequency on (Capitol) Hill, and of\nnew regulations from the U.S. Administration,\" Younger said.\n    \"The defence balance of trade with the U.K. and other allies\nis still markedly in favour of the U.S.\"\n    Thatcher will visit Washington next month for talks with\nPresident Reagan. U.K. Government officials said she would\nprobably raise the subject of defence trade when they meet.\n    The report by Parliament's Defence Committee said that the\nBritish position towards SDI was based on four points agreed\nbetween Thatcher and Reagan in December 1984, they being that:\n    - The aim was not superiority, but to maintain balance\n    - SDI-related deploymewnt would be a matter for negotiation\n    - The overall aim is to enhance, not undercut, deterence\n    - East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security with\nreduced levels of offensive systems on both sides.\n    The committee in its report said, \"we very much support the\ngovernment's view that SDI research should proceed only within\nthe framework of the Camp David \"four points\" and in particular\nthat it should be in entire conformity with the provisions of\nthe ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty.\"\n    \"We note that all present and envisaged SDI work undertaken\nby UK contractors falls in the \"narrow\" interpretation of the\ntreaty, (and) we recommend that the government takes the\nappropriate steps to ensure that this continues to be the case.\"\n    That definition prohibits the U.S. And Soviet Union from\ndeveloping, testing or deploying ABM systems, experts said.\n    That recommendation would of course change, it added, if \"it\nhas become clear that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in\nrenouncing the constraints of the narrow interpretation.\"\n    Regarding possibilities for technology spin-offs, the\ncommittee report said that \"the present predominance of \"paper\nstudies\" in SDI contracts awarded to British firms and\ninstitutions militates against any such achievement.\"\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003",

Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his\ncontroversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.\nfarmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they\napprove of the proposal.\n    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per\nbushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for\nsoybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on\nplanted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs\nfor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.\n    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market\nsharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting\nnations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the\nfirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings\nexamining farm programs.\n    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his\n\"Family Farm Act.\"\n    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income\nand reduce government spending on agriculture.\n    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not\nruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would\nincrease overall revenue from exports.\n    This would be done by seeking agreement among major\nexporting countries including the European Community on market\nsharing at agreed high prices.\n    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing\nthat such a grain export cartel is not workable.\n    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports\nwould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices\nstem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from\nhigh farm product prices.\n    Harkin cited what he termed \"excessive\" net returns on\nequity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct\nMonfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.\nHeinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct\nQuaker Oats.\n    -- Harkin said a \"legitimate\" concern about his bill would\nbe the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.\n    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would\nallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.\ngrain stocks for three years.\n    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a\n\"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said.\n    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm\nparticipation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current\nfarm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm\nprograms in order to receive credit for planting and to protect\nfarm income.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

It said the\nrate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly\nhigher than in the first half of this year.\n    The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated\nsomewhat during the early months of 1987. \n    Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory\nadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation\nhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to\nreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.\n    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand\npick up in the second half of this year. But both data are\nlikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.\n    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for\nthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six\nmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct\nfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Last\nyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing\neconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.\n    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,\nbut will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.\n    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five\npct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in\nimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour\ncosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report\nsaid.\n    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand\nshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption\nmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.\n    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in\nItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and\nadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988.

        "body": "Japan's trade surplus is likely to\ncontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad\nincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\nsaid.\n    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the\nOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last\nyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while\nexport markets rose by only two pct.\n    But it said this differential between the growth of\ndomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,\n\"thus weakening the international adjustment process.\"\n    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two\npct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct\nin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will\nrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in\n1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.\n    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion\nyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand\nand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the\nmeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite\npossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have\nworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.\n    The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account\nsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial\nnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressure\non the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead\nmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus\nweaken domestic growth.\n    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to\ngorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct\ngrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance\non inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a\n0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if\nthe two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,\naccording to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy\nresearch groups.\n    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute\nof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross\nborder trade would benefit both countries.\n    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added \"the two nations'\ngenerally harmonious trade relations are probably not\nsustainable without a new agreement.\"\n    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade\ntotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding\ntalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers\nremaining between their two countries.\n    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both\nsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining\nremained.\n    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties\ncould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on\nPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and\nthis could hit some Canadian trade practices.\n    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto\nindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral\nfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.\n    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to\na resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.\nexports to Canada.\n    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime\nMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and\nenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which\nwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.\n    It would also increase the gross national products of both\ncountries.\n    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all\ntariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules\nfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on government\nprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

Belgian inflation could\nstabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus\nwill probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.\n    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming\nits borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to\ncheck the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.\n    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5\npct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming\nless competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to\ndecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the\nprivate sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.\n    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987\nand stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining\ndomestic gas prices.\n    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster\ngrowth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in\nwages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.\nREUTER\n\u0003",

Both fixed investment and private consumption\nwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain\nstrong.\n    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply\nnext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European\nCommunity and declining competitiveness.\n    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards\nfollowing an increase early this year linked with the\nintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due\nto cold weather.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

Denmark was also expected to see a\nslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in\nSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark\nand Norway.\n    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic\nstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained\nand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.\n REUTER\n\u0003",

But inflation appears to be\nheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer\nprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next\nyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.\n    \"Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors\nbehind the avoidance of recession,\" the report said.\n    The current account balance of payments deficit is expected\nto be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after\nhitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.\n    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly\nto around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will\nstill be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is\nexpected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,\nunemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct\nthis year.\n    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to\naround four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about\nthat level in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

        "body": "Prospects for world economic growth remain\nvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is\nurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize\ncurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.\n    \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,\nand ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments\nimbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its\ngloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.\n    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of\nwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only\n2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's\n2.5 pct growth rate.\n    \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area\ncomfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the\nOECD's economics and statistics department, said.\n    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising\ninflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,\nCombining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world\ndebt problem to increase the risks of a world economic\ndownturn.\n    \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth\nremain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major\ncountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest\nrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible\nlabor markets.\n    But private sector confidence had been undermined by\nuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for\nconfidence to be restored, it is important for governments\nswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"\n    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord\nof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.\n    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major\ncountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to\nundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal\npolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand\nin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.\n    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced\nrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public works\nand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this\nprocess, though it was too early to estimate its precise\nimpact.\n    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic\ndemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.\n    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has\nworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast\nto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct\nincrease in 1986.\n    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the\nunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the\naverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last\nyear.\n    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world\nagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from\nprice guarantees and other measures linked to production\ntowards direct income support for farmers.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
